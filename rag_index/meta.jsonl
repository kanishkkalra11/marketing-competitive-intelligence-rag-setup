The goal is to help equip US technology organizations with the information and foresight to better position themselves for a robust and resilient future. 22024 technology industry outlook The technology industry flourished during the early pandemic years as companies accelerated their digital transformation efforts. But the industry has hit several speed bumps over the past two years. High inflation, elevated interest rates, and considerable macroeconomic and global uncertainties contributed to a softening of consumer spending, lower product demand, falling market capitalizations, and workforce reductions in 2022.1 Headwinds continued into 2023, with slight weakening of global tech spending and rising layoffs. But there are now glimmers of hope that a tech comeback may be imminent: Economists have lowered their assessments of recession risk, and analysts are optimistic that the tech sector could return to modest growth in 2024.2 As the technology market faced heightened global challenges over the past few years—geopolitical tensions, supply chain volatility, raw material shortages, and emerging regulations—Deloitte urged tech leaders to evaluate where manufacturing happens, to improve the transparency and resiliency of their supply chains, and to prepare proactively for future systemic risks.3 We suggested leaders use technology to streamline business processes, rely more on intelligent automation, reduce tech debt by implementing leading practices for software development, and modernize legacy architectures by migrating to cloud resources and XaaS.4 We also recommended that tech companies consider how to extend their reach into other industries, using digital advancements to spur transformation.5 Finally, we advised leaders to build up talent in critical areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation (RPA), and cybersecurity.6 With global and economic uncertainties continuing into 2024, these recommendations remain important. But it’s likely time to refocus on innovation and growth as well. A Q4 2023 Deloitte survey of 122 tech executives revealed an optimistic perspective: 55% of respondents rated the tech industry as “healthy” or “very healthy,” and even more (62%) believe it will be at that level six months from now.7 Asked to choose their company’s primary area of focus, “efficiency” topped the list (with 25% selecting it), while “innovation” and “productivity” tied for second place at 21%. “Growth” was a close third, at 19%. These leaders described the current state of the tech industry as “innovative” and “evolving”—and nearly two-thirds (62%) believed it was a good time for their company to take greater risks. Some of the strategies we expect tech leaders to focus on in 2024 and beyond include: •Angling for a comeback, with help from cloud, AI, and cybersecurity. Enterprise spending on software and IT services— particularly artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity technology—is expected to enable the most growth in the tech market over the coming year.8 Tech leaders should assess how they might shift or augment their offerings to meet that demand. While generative AI has sparked imaginations and headlines, with tech giants investing billions9 and startups playing a key role,10 enterprise purchasing in this specific category isn’t expected to ramp up until at least the second half of 2024.11 Deloitte ex", "char_len": 5448}

The next year is expected to be transitional for generative AI, with tech companies experimenting and finding applications that can drive efficiency and productivity. Some will likely evaluate how to speed up software development with generative AI-enabled tools. At the same time, providers can determine how to best deliver generative AI capabilities and how to monetize them. As generative AI investment and experimentation accelerate in the coming months, the legal and regulatory landscape may evolve rapidly, setting the stage for greater adoption in the second half of 2024 and into 2025. •Reckoning with regulations for the tech industry. Governments around the world are evaluating the impacts that massive tech platforms and social networks have on businesses and consumers. In the coming months, regulations in the European Union and the United States will likely take effect, pushing tech companies to prioritize data protection, harm reduction, the ethical use of AI, and commitment to sustainability goals.13 A global minimum tax aims to close loopholes and push corporations to pay more, while new credits and incentives are designed to spur sustainable growth and job creation. With strong collaboration between business, legal, accounting, and finance teams, tech companies can elevate compliance efforts into competitive advantages. Each of these themes represents a strategic opportunity for tech companies to reduce risk and set the stage for sustainable growth in the next 12 to 18 months. Prudent investment in supply chain resilience and data governance may serve as a hedge against geopolitical and regulatory shifts, while generative AI can streamline operations in the immediate term and accelerate longer-term innovation efforts. Executive summary 32024 technology industry outlook 2024 technology industry outlook44High interest rates, worries about the potential for a slowing economy, and geopolitical challenges contributed to a slight weakening of global tech spending in 2023.14 Facing decelerating revenue growth, many tech companies ramped up layoffs last year, continuing to adjust their workforces after aggressive hiring in prior years.15 Now, there may be light on the horizon: Economists are more optimistic about the US economy as a whole, lowering the risk of a recession in 2024 to below 50%. Deloitte’s analysis pegs the risk at just 20%.16 For the tech sector specifically, analysts are optimistic about a potential return to modest growth in 2024, with more robust prospects for 2025. Predictions for growth in global IT spending in 2024 cover a range from 5.7% to 8%.17 There are signs that aspects of a tech rebound may already be underway. In 2023, the stock values of the so-called Magnificent Seven—the seven largest US tech companies—surged, outperforming the rest of the S&P 500 Index.18 The heavily tech-weighted Nasdaq Composite index took a mere 18 months to recover 80% of its 2021 all- time high—versus taking 14 years to regain 80% of its 2000 peak after the dot-com crisis.19 At the smaller end of the spectrum, startups continued to contend with lower VC deal activity and valuations— but Deloitte expects that the valuation corrections may fuel renewed interest from venture capitalists and corporate buyers.20 The 2023 uptick in tech IPO activity—following a slump since the end of 2021—could signal the start of a positive trend that allows more tech companies to exit successfully.21 While there are some positive indicators, tech leaders should remain vigilant about ongoing risks and forge their own careful strategies for growth in 2024. What could help drive this tech rebound? Global IT investments are expected to be fueled largely by double-digit growth in spending for software and IT services in 2024.22 Analysts estimate that public cloud spending will grow by more than 20%, and they foresee stronger demand for cybersecurity.23 AI investment (not", "char_len": 5196}

Deloitte expects generative AI growth in 2024 to be modest, with adoption and spending picking up in the second half, followed by more robust growth in 2025.30 Tech execs seem bullish about imminent generative AI spending: More than a quarter (27%) of respondents to the Deloitte survey selected generative AI as a top-three industry growth driver for the coming year.31 Perhaps due to the level of investment or effort required for full-scale generative AI initiatives, respondents from larger companies (those with 10,000+ employees or US$10B+ in revenue) selected generative AI at a higher rate than others. Notably, tech giants with plans to invest billions in generative AI will likely play a part in the sector’s rebound.32 Cybersecurity is also expected to play a key role in the comeback. Analysts forecast that global spending on security and risk management will see low double-digit growth from 2023 to 2024.33 Motivators include a persistent threat landscape, ongoing cloud adoption, remote work, the emergence of generative AI, and evolving data privacy and governance regulations.34 While the rapid adoption of generative AI may expose organizations to new attack surfaces and techniques, AI may also play a pivotal role in speeding up breach detection and containment.35 An uptick in tech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2024 would be another sign of a tech recovery—but is far from certain. Leaders have traditionally viewed strategic tech M&A as a growth engine, but with the continued high cost of financing and focus on belt-tightening, 2023 proved disappointing for tech M&A. Deal volume and the total market value of those transactions remain well below their 2021 highs.36 On the bright side, a handful of billion-dollar-plus enterprise tech deals has given analysts a reason to hope that the tide may turn for tech M&A in the coming months.37 Technology geared toward productivity and efficiency improvement—including industrial automation and decision intelligence platforms—is seen as having the potential to spark renewed M&A activity.38 AI may also prove to be a driver: Companies may obtain AI technology and expertise via acquisitions, rather than building their own capabilities.39 •How will our company navigate the evolving economic landscape, continued high cost of borrowing, and ongoing geopolitical challenges while still achieving our growth objectives? •Has our company evaluated how adopting AI—specifically generative AI—might help us drive productivity and efficiency gains?

All critical product components and elements of the value chain should have redundancies and alternate sources. Moreover, tech companies should work closely with suppliers to ensure resilience and flexibility throughout the production network. As the geopolitical landscape continues to shift, governments worldwide are redefining their trade policies. Tech companies should monitor these changes and align their strategies accordingly. Countries and trading blocs often offer incentives, subsidies, and tax credits to encourage the localization of technology supply chains and innovation hubs.42 This trend is particularly evident in the semiconductor industry, where the United States and Europe are making substantial investments to build out domestic chip fabrication capacity, especially at advanced processing nodes. They’re also ramping up assembly and packaging capabilities, although from a low base.43 Strategic planning should include sustainability assessments, tracking, and reporting, both to secure maximum credit and ensure compliance with local and international regulations.44 After severe chip shortages began in 2020, the US government passed the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022—which provides $52 billion in financial assistance to spur research and manufacturing in the domestic semiconductor industry.45 Semiconductor manufacturers are working to identify which parts of their supply chain should be domestic (onshoring), which parts can be in countries close to home (nearshoring), and which parts can be handled in countries considered to be allies (friendshoring).46 For some tech companies, particularly hardware and electronics manufacturers, full onshoring may be impractical or infeasible— but a blend of onshoring and friendshoring could help provide a hedge against instability.47 As organizations identify potential choke points and determine how to reengineer their operations and processes to improve resilience, they may also focus on building redundancy into their research and development operations and talent pool. Recent geopolitical crises underscore the risks of over-relying on tech talent in any one location.48 Leaders should consider expanding their workforce in secure regions and taking care that pivotal functions and roles are distributed. Tech jobs have specialized training and educational needs that continue to evolve due to advancements such as generative AI. Redistributing talent pools likely means partnering with universities and engineering schools; working more closely with local tech schools, vocational schools, and community colleges; and supporting national institutions that promote STEM fields.49 Tech companies may be able to boost resilience in their operations and supply chains by co-investment and knowledge-sharing initiatives with channel partners, contract manufacturers, and suppliers. This could involve helping suppliers with approvals and logistics as they work to establish facilities in different regions, as well as offering essential talent, engineering, and administrative proficiency as they spin up new operations. Throughout 2024, tech companies will likely continue to prioritize sustainability and resilience, aiming to strike the right balance between globalization and onshoring/self-reliance. Organizations should continue to globalize their operations to take advantage of lower costs, greater access to talent, and faster innovation. However, they should also look to onshore or self-source critical components and operations to reduce their risks from global disruptions. Striking a balance between globalization and self-reliance •Has our company adequately evaluated our supply chain and operational vulnerabilities?

Innovating with generative AI In the past year, US tech companies focused intensely on generative AI, embedding it into their offerings and signaling plans to double down on investments.50 Across the sector, many tech companies will face the challenge of how to augment their products and services with generative AI to remain competitive. On the software front, Deloitte has predicted that nearly all enterprise software companies will embed generative AI into at least some of their products in 2024 and that the revenue uplift (for these companies and for the cloud providers of generative AI processing capacity) will approach a US$10 billion run rate by the end of the year.51 Deloitte expects 2024 to be a transition year, as generative AI-enabled software tools launch and adoption and revenues start to gain traction, setting the stage for more robust potential growth in 2025.52 On the hardware front, Deloitte expects the uplift for chips and servers that execute generative AI to surpass US$50 billion in 2024.53 Several tech companies associated with generative AI experienced rising valuations in 2023, partially due to excitement around the technology’s potential.54 However, they’re still figuring out how to monetize and profit from generative AI. Deploying and scaling generative AI involves heavy-duty servers packed with expensive, power-hungry chips, and the operational costs can range from US$0.01 to US$0.36 per generative AI query.55 Some providers who charge a per user per month (PUPM) fee may be losing money currently due to those who use the service more heavily than anticipated.56 We expect that tech companies will continue to grapple with how to translate generative AI into increased revenue, experimenting with a variety of pricing models (such as consumption-based, PUPM, or a hybrid approach).57 Tech leaders should consider how to best utilize and deliver this new functionality. This could involve using “off the shelf” solutions from cloud and tech providers with generative AI integrated, building their own proprietary solutions (which could be prohibitively expensive), or partnering with co-developers. Tech companies may use all these approaches to incorporate generative AI into existing or new offerings. One possibility is that AI solutions will evolve into an ecosystem where large players provide foundational platforms and contextual models as commodities, while additional parties build capabilities and functions on top to cater to the specific needs of their customers.58 Focusing on productivity Like their counterparts in other industries, many tech leaders are experimenting with embedding generative AI capabilities into their workflows to assist professionals and augment business processes.59 At this stage, many are focused on optimizing productivity and efficiency. A recent Deloitte survey of marketing leaders found that 26% already use generative AI (e.g., for content marketing), and another 45% expect to use it by the end of 2024. Users estimated the technology has saved them more than 11 hours per week.60 Generative AI is being used to facilitate sales—from interpreting customer requirements documents to developing proposals and prioritizing leads—and to improve customer service (e.g., helping human agents respond to questions and solve problems and even anticipating customers’ future needs).61 Research has revealed that more than eight in 10 sales professionals surveyed feel using generative AI helps them speed up customer communication and increase sales, while nine in 10 service professionals believe it helps them address customer needs more quickly.62 Companies are also driving back-office efficiency by embedding generative AI capabilities into functions such as finance and order management— accelerating processes, reporting, and insights.

Avoiding legal and regulatory pitfalls The use of generative AI raises considerable challenges around data privacy and content use. One area of concern for tech leaders is whether the large language models (LLMs) used in generative AI implementations have been trained using copyright-protected content.68 To address concerns, several leading software companies have pledged to assume liability in case their tools expose customers to IP infringement claims.69 Another misgiving is whether a company might lose control of its own data when it’s added to public models, whether through accidental data leaks or adversarial prompt engineering.70 As a result, Deloitte expects that more companies will begin training generative AI on their private enterprise data—but this approach could raise challenges around access to talent and specialized GPUs.71 Generative AI adopters should weigh the risks of publicly trained models and the expense and expertise required for building proprietary models as they decide which approach is right for their company. International regulations governing privacy, potential harm, and ethical practices are also high on the list of concerns for generative AI adopters. The EU’s AI Act, for instance, is expected to be adopted in the second quarter of 2024, with a 24-month implementation period for most obligations.72 US companies are working to comply with the Biden administration’s October 2023 executive order governing the safe and secure development and use of AI.73 The order will require certain developers of “very powerful” foundation models to share safety test results with the government. It will also impose requirements for federal agencies, including the use of watermarks to identify AI-generated content, measures to protect user privacy, and efforts to minimize bias (see “ Reckoning with regulations for the tech industry ”). •Have we determined which use cases and workflows could be best improved with generative AI? Have we assessed where we could deploy generative AI in our value chain? •Are we evaluating how generative AI could create opportunities for new products, services, business models, and, ultimately, new revenues? •Does our workforce have the right set of skills for upcoming generative AI initiatives? For example, have we considered training existing staff to improve generative AI literacy?

The executive order directs the development of both voluntary and mandatory guidance to govern the use of AI in the public and private sectors. It includes more than 100 directives to agencies, which will mostly be implemented over the next year. The Commerce Department will play an important role in implementation and has formed a US AI Safety Institute to help develop technical guidance for other agencies.80 Reckoning with regulations for the tech industry Global tax equality Another factor that tech companies will likely encounter in 2024 is the OECD’s Pillar Two global minimum tax (GMT). Some countries have passed legislation and many others are proposing legislation to activate these rules. This ruleset is designed to ensure that multinational corporations pay a minimum of 15% regardless of location, removing the incentive to locate headquarters in low-tax jurisdictions. Certain factors, including credits and incentives, may bring the effective tax rate in a country below 15%, in which case these companies will have to pay a “top-up” tax to meet the 15% threshold. This may reduce or eliminate the benefit of the incentive.81 For the tech industry, the way different jurisdictions operationalize these rules and how they define and treat credits and incentives may lead to operational shifts. Countries may jockey to build out incentive programs that don’t have an impact on effective tax rates. ESG credits and compliance No regulatory outlook would be complete without a discussion of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting requirements. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) expands the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures from around 12,000 to more than 50,000.82 It also imposes requirements around double materiality ; companies must report the impacts that ESG efforts have on their businesses and the impacts they’re expected to have on the environment, human rights, social standards, and sustainability-related risk.83 These rules apply to multinational entities (like tech giants) that meet certain revenue criteria. European branches of these companies may have to provide consolidated reporting on their parent company’s activities as well. In the United States, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council has proposed a rule that would require certain federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as their climate-related financial risk, and set science-based targets to reduce their emissions.84 California’s Climate Accountability Package, which was signed into law in fall 2023, requires climate disclosures and climate-related financial risk reporting from any company with revenues greater than US$1 billion doing business in California.85 Taken together, these developments could drive increased investment in cybersecurity, data management, and ESG reporting solutions.

The World Manufacturing Forum is its flagship event, where industry, academia, and governments from around the world come together to exchange their views and share their visions for a 360-degree view of the future of manufacturing, including its challenges, issues, and opportunities for positive change. The World Manufacturing Forum serves as an open and independent platform for policy experts to assess their national, regional, and state industrial policies with a global perspective, for industrial leaders to benchmark their business practices internationally, and for eminent academic and research innovators to listen carefully to and discuss the wide-reaching calls for applied research and technological advancements to support the global manufacturing sector in playing its key role as the backbone of economic development and social prosperity for many nations. As part of the World Manufacturing Forum, an annual whitepaper, the World Manufacturing Report , has been published and presented during the event since 2018 to examine relevant topics for the global manufacturing sector (from skills to key enabling technologies to innovative business and operating models), introducing their facts & figures and offering key recommendations on how to address them to create defensive positions and distinctive competitive advantages. For this year, the 2024 World Manufacturing Report - New Perspectives for the Future of Manufacturing: Outlook 2030 - presents a global strategic analysis and forecast of the (geo)political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental trends and tipping points that are shaping or will be shaping in the following years all manufacturing industries worldwide with a horizon towards 2030, providing as in previous Reports 10 Key Recommendations for those actions needed for futureproofing manufacturing operations and supply chains in the face of a present and foreseen volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) business environment for the sector. The World Manufacturing Foundation and the Editorial Board of the 2024 World Manufacturing Report believe that the findings and recommendations presented in this whitepaper have the potential to provide actionable insights and measures for policymakers and industrial leaders to enhance the sustainability and resilience of manufacturing operations and supply chains to promote a future that ensures economic, social, and environmental prosperity for all, even in the face of adversity.

By embracing technological advancements, fostering innovation, and solid multi-stakeholder partnerships, the 2024 World Manufacturing Report encourages the creation of a shared vision for how the manufacturing sector could evolve towards competitive industrial development models that align with the new sustainable manufacturing blueprints for an economically, socially, and environmentally prosperous future. World Manufacturing Report 2024 6 Project Methodology The World Manufacturing Report is an annual whitepaper discussing critical trends in the manufacturing sector. This year, the focus has been on “New Perspectives for the Future of Manufacturing, ” examining the (geo) political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental trends shaping global manufacturing with an Outlook towards 2030. The 2024 World Manufacturing Report was developed by a heterogeneous Editorial T eam in terms of gender and country and supported by an International Advisory Board composed of people from prestigious universities and organisations. The Report was built upon integrating scientific and grey literature sources through an extensive review of the state-of-the-art and practice. This process led to analysing the main tipping points for the manufacturing sector as it heads towards 2030 and providing recommended actions to face them. Finally, as for the past four years (2020-2023), the 2024 World Manufacturing Report has included a set of case studies written by Young Manufacturing Leaders. These were selected as winners from among the Young Manufacturing Leaders participants in a dedicated call for papers. The Young Manufacturing Leaders project, co-funded by the European Union under the EIT Manufacturing Initiative, is a global network of students and young workers interested in a career in the manufacturing sector. World Manufacturing Report 2024 7 World Manufacturing Report 2024 81 New perspectives for the future of manufacturing World Manufacturing Report 2024 9Outlook 2030: “A strategic foresight exercise based on future manufacturing scenarios where positive or negative tipping points are reached, and actions can be planned upfront to leverage these upbeat impetuses or avoid those thumbs-down momentums.” A manufacturing outlook is a strategic planning exercise that involves analysing and forecasting future scenarios based on trends, challenges, and opportunities that could positively or negatively impact the global manufacturing sector. The 2024 World Manufacturing Report presents a unique Outlook 2030 for the global manufacturing sector. It helps manufacturers worldwide anticipate positive and negative tipping points for their industries based on the potential geopolitical, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental forces that may create them. By combining positive and negative manufacturing tipping points and future scenarios, the 2024 World Manufacturing Report offers insights for manufacturers to better prepare for plausible significant changes in the global manufacturing landscape, ensuring they remain competitive and resilient in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. Outlook 2030 Driving forces shaping the future of manufacturing towards 2030 Driving Force: “A force that propels or inhibits manufacturing innovation, automation, and sustainability to meet future global demands.” Geopolitical driving forces Political stability and international cooperation can create a favourable environment for manufacturing sector growth, with trade agreements, infrastructure investments, and government incentives stimulating industrial expansion and technological advancement.

However, economic downturns, inflation, and fluctuating currency exchange rates can negatively impact manufacturing. Recessions can decrease demand, forcing manufacturing companies to downsize or delay investments. Rising material and labour costs and global supply chain disruptions can squeeze profit margins and make it difficult for manufacturers to remain competitive. Economic inequality can also impact consumer spending patterns, affecting demand for specific products. Social driving forces Social trends, such as the growing demand for mass- customised or personalised products and the emphasis on their sustainability, can drive innovation and open up new market opportunities in manufacturing industries. Consumer preferences for ethically produced goods can lead to higher sales for manufacturing companies prioritising social responsibility. Additionally, focusing on diversity and inclusion in the workforce can lead to more creative problem-solving and improved corporate culture, enhancing productivity and employee satisfaction. On the other hand, changing social expectations can pose challenges for manufacturers. The increasing emphasis on corporate social responsibility (CSR) requires manufacturers to invest in ethical practices, which can be costly and complex. Additionally, shifts in consumer behaviours, like the move towards minimalism or digital World Manufacturing Report 2024 10consumption, can reduce demand for physical products. Labour shortages, driven by demographic shifts or evolving career preferences, can also create challenges in finding and retaining skilled workers. Technological driving forces T echnological advancements, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), are revolutionising many manufacturing industries by enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and enabling new product innovations. These advanced technologies allow for more precise and flexible production processes, better quality control, and the ability to respond to market changes rapidly. The continued development of the Industry 4.0 paradigm will enable manufacturers to create brighter, more connected factories that can optimise production resources and reduce waste. However, the rapid pace of technological change also presents significant challenges. Adopting new technologies can be prohibitive, particularly for smaller manufacturing companies. Cybersecurity threats are also a considerable concern, as more connected systems create new vulnerabilities. Also, the reliance on complex technologies can lead to operational disruptions if systems fail or there is a need for more skilled workers to manage and maintain them. The digital divide between manufacturing regions and companies could exacerbate inequalities within the sector. Legal driving forces Clear and consistent legal frameworks can provide stability and predictability for manufacturers, enabling them to plan and invest confidently. Regulations that promote fair competition, protection of intellectual property, and ensure safety and environmental standards can create a level playing field and encourage innovation. Government incentives for sustainable practices and technological innovation can drive industry growth and modernisation. Yet increasingly complex and varied legal requirements across different jurisdictions can create significant challenges for global manufacturers. Compliance with environmental, safety, and labour regulations can increase operational costs and complexity. Frequent regulation changes, particularly in data protection or environmental standards, can lead to uncertainty and require costly adjustments. Non-compliance risks, including fines and reputational damage, are also significant concerns for manufacturers operating in multiple legal environments.

These processes inevitably lead to qualitative differences, positive or negative, in the system’s state, which are often irreversible.3 A positive manufacturing tipping point is a critical threshold where geopolitical, economic, social, technological, legal and/or environmental forces trigger significant changes for good in manufacturing and supply chain practices, self-reinforcing progress towards more sustainable and equitable manufacturing ecosystems. These tipping points can lead to rapid and widespread transformations World Manufacturing Report 2024 11trade efficiency, followed by shortages of raw materials and closure of supply routes, up to the extreme need to relocate production facilities. Economic tipping points In the global manufacturing landscape, an economic tipping point refers to a critical threshold where a significant, positive or negative change or shift occurs in the economic conditions that determine a market’s manufacturing and consumption patterns. These tipping points can lead to new business and operating models, emerging industrial leaders, evolving market dynamics, or fresh sources of competitive advantage after the economic alterations have passed, with some being winners or losers because of these economic changes. Consequently, positive economic tipping points refer to critical moments where a favourable transformative change occurs in the economy, leading to widespread benefits for the manufacturing sector and society. Examples of these moments include the achievement of economies of scale in novel manufacturing paradigms such as green manufacturing, lowering the marginal costs of production of green products, and leading to increased investment, job creation, and sustainable economic growth in green industries, or shifts to new economic models like the circular economy that can reduce the need for virgin raw materials and minimise waste, lowering overall production costs and creating new revenue streams from repairs, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and recycling activities. Overall, these positive tipping points enhance productivity, reduce production costs, and create new growth opportunities for manufacturers. Conversely, negative economic tipping points imply critical events where economic changes adversely affect of the manufacturing industries, like digital and green transitions, driving systemic shifts towards sustainable industrial development. Hence, positive tipping points are crucial for accelerating the evolution of new sustainable manufacturing businesses and operating models. This can help overcome the inertia to keep or delay the status quo and address the grand manufacturing challenges many industries must soon face.4 Conversely, a negative manufacturing tipping point is a predominant detrimental event or momentum in time where geopolitical, economic, social, technological, legal, and/or environmental forces trigger negative shifts or cause damaging impacts to positive manufacturing and supply chain practices. These forces switch manufacturing ecosystems into an undesired system state, causing degradation to their performance and surrounding environment. These undesired tipping points can quickly lead to cascading adverse events that ultimately destabilise and threaten the global manufacturing sector’s economic, environmental, and social sustainability.5 Types of positive and negative tipping points Geopolitic", "char_len": 6007}

These positive tipping points aim for a more stable and diversified global economy with economic development opportunities for all markets, from emerging to developed, increased international trade, and advanced sustainable manufacturing and supply chain practices. Alternatively, negative geopolitical tipping points are critical incidents that disrupt the global manufacturing landscape. These adverse events include trade wars, protectionism, export restrictions, and regulatory fragmentation, to mention a few that disturb or even interrupt international trade and global supply chain operations. Their cascading effects can negatively impact the global manufacturing sector, for instance, starting with increased production costs and reduced international World Manufacturing Report 2024 12manufacturing industries and their markets. Some instances that could cause a negative economic tipping point are trade wars, labour shortages, resource scarcity, and financial crises. These types of tipping points, first of all, can be connected to other kinds of tipping points, such as geopolitical and social ones and can have profound effects leading to reduced economic growth, a slowdown in global trade, higher unemployment rates, the rise of production resource prices, and delays in investments. Social tipping points In worldwide manufacturing, a social tipping point means a profound, positive or negative moment when cumulative social pressures or societal factors like labour movements, or even sometimes new labour regulations, reach a point that causes a significant change or shift, for better or worse, in manufacturing practices related to labour standards and working conditions. In their positive type, these tipping points advocate for more socially responsible manufacturing industries offering fair wages, safe and healthy working conditions, respectful treatment of all employees, and engagement with the local communities that surround them to nurture positive relationships. On the one hand, positive social tipping points describe a severe moment when societal pressures create beneficial changes for the workforce, ensuring notable improvements in workers’ quality of personal and professional life. These joyous moments include adopting fair labour standards, including health and safety, strengthening workers’ rights and unions, investing in workers’ training and development, promoting gender equality and diversity, creating more inclusive workplaces, and improving work- life balance initiatives. By focusing on making these positive moments happen, manufacturing industries can create more supportive work environments and engage their workforces in their jobs, leading to increased productivity. On the other hand, negative social tipping points relate to a critical time when societal pressures, sometimes combined with economic and technological pressures (tipping points), lead to harmful or destabilising shifts in the labour market and working conditions, severely affecting workers’ employment rates, wages, safety standards, and overall physical and mental wellbeing. Patterns of these negative tipping points include discrimination and inequality in labour practices, evasion of safety and occupational health regulations, labour exploitation, and even unjustified job displacements due to automation and robotics. Addressing these social issues will require a strong focus on labour rights, protections, and equitable practices to ensure that workers are not left behind as industries evolve or are pressured. Technological tipping points In international manufacturing, a technological tipping point indicates a point in time when a specific technology or set of technologies reaches or fails to reach a level of maturity, affordability, and adoption that causes a dramatic shift in global manufacturing and supply chain practices, like the case of the new ", "char_len": 5921}

Conversely, negative technological tipping points can occur when a new technology or set of technologies recognise that they have failed to deliver their promised value and, therefore, the possibility of return on investment or when their delivered benefits are outweighed by their utilisation risks. For instance, cybersecurity threats if proper cybersecurity frameworks are not implemented before connecting any IIoT device, equipment, or system World Manufacturing Report 2024 13to the enterprise industrial network. Furthermore, it is also possible to consider other hybrid negative socio- technological tipping points like an overreliance on automation or lack of digital skills in the workforce that have led to big failures in adopting new technologies with significant setbacks in the digital transformation journey of a manufacturer. Thus, careful consideration and management of technological changes are advised to mitigate their negative tipping points. Legal tipping points Within a global manufacturing environment, a legal tipping point refers to a critical moment when an international (or national) regulation, law, policy, standard, or agreement changes, for better or worse, with significant, positive or negative impacts on the way manufacturing industries operate and conduct their businesses. Consequently, these tipping points drive substantial changes in industry practices (including trade), investment decisions, and competitive dynamics. Moreover, legal tipping points are sometimes related to one or more of the already- mentioned or to-be-mentioned tipping points. In critical times, positive legal tipping points convey new legal or regulatory developments that drive significant beneficial changes for the manufacturing sector, customers, and society. These changes can incentivise sustainability and innovation with regulations promoting, for instance, the green manufacturing paradigm or the digital and smart manufacturing paradigms, or trade liberalisation through free trade agreements and the harmonisation of international industry standards, including labour rights and intellectual property (IP) protection, that can enhance global supply chain efficiency, allowing manufacturers to compete more effectively, to some extent, in the worldwide marketplace. Then, negative legal tipping points can occur when overly cautious legal frameworks overregulate, for example, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence or inadequate enforcement of environmental, trade, IP , or labour regulations, leading to a loss of competitiveness for everyone. Environmental tipping points In the ecosphere of manufacturing, an environmental tipping point defines a critical threshold, positive or negative, beyond which the ecological impacts of manufacturing processes, including their supply chains, become irreversibly damaging for the planet or may start allowing for its recovery for good.

Lastly, negative environmental tipping points highlight the critical thresholds beyond which the environmental impacts of manufacturing and supply chain operations become so severe that they cause irreversible damage to the ecosphere of the sector and society and whose cascading adverse effects are so complex, if not impossible, to reverse. Infamous examples it is hoped will be avoided are climate catastrophe, critical resource exhaustion (like rare earth materials, fundamental for technology development), pollution overload, and waste management failure. Avoiding these negative environmental tipping points is crucial for ensuring the long-term ecological sustainability of the global manufacturing sector. World Manufacturing Report 2024 14Green transformation as a growth engine for the future of manufacturing Scenario 1: “Redefinition of growth by integrating circular economy principles and embracing emerging green markets while always striving for a net positive impact.” Figure 1 “Green transformation as a growth engine” scenarioBeyond 2030: four scenarios for the future of manufacturing In considering the future of manufacturing beyond 2030, ‘scenarios’ serve as valuable tools for strategic foresight exercises. These can help manufacturers envision, plan for, and increase their chances to thrive in inconceivable future competitive arenas. They represent different, plausible competitive paths for the sector, whether shaped by technological advancements, regulatory changes, or shifts in global trade dynamics. Thus, scenario planning encourages diverse thinking and inspires creative strategy development to defend a competitive edge or develop new competitive advantages. The following four scenarios for the future of manufacturing are not predictions but imaginative explorations or narrative views of various possible futures beyond 2030 for the global manufacturing sector. Their aim is not to endorse a specific direction but to provide a framework for discussion, enabling decision- makers to anticipate grand challenges better, seize opportunities, and craft resilient strategies for an evolving manufacturing landscape. World Manufacturing Report 2024 15In this transformative scenario, manufacturing industries worldwide experience a profound shift towards sustainability, driven by robust regulatory frameworks, evolving consumer preferences, and strategic investment in green technologies. Manufacturers fundamentally alter their business and operating models to integrate circular economy principles, which emphasise designing products for durability, repairability, and recyclability. Hence, this shift goes beyond incremental changes, aiming for a systemic transformation that reduces environmental impacts. In contrast to enhancing manufacturing efficiency, sustainable manufacturing could also be regarded as a core value. By 2030, sustainability will become the cornerstone of manufacturing industries, not merely as a compliance requirement but as a core value embedded in every facet of operations. This shift is driven by growing (green) consumer demand for environmentally responsible products, stricter regulations, and the increasing awareness of the impact of manufacturing. In this scenario, manufacturers prioritise sustainability from the initial design phase to the end of their product’s lifecycle.

Manufacturers adopt practices like material recycling, product take-back schemes, and renewable energy integration. Additionally, they invest in energy-efficient production technologies and renewable energy sources to reduce their carbon footprint. However, the effectiveness of these sustainable practices must be carefully evaluated to avoid the pitfalls of greenwashing. Independent verification and transparent reporting are essential to prove that sustainability efforts result in tangible environmental benefits.

Manufacturing regions and companies with access to cutting-edge technologies such as AI, IoT, and robotics gain a significant competitive advantage over those that lag. Research on artificial intelligence and data science leads to the trends that manufacturing is heading for a development that could be subsumed in “digital first” . Manufacturing is instead seen as a domain for applying industrial artificial intelligence and data analytics. In this scenario, data becomes the most valuable resource in manufacturing, with AI leading every aspect of production, from product design and development to manufacturing to logistics and customer service. AI is at the core of all production operations. Advanced AI systems manage and optimise production lines with minimal human intervention, making real-time decisions. These AI systems analyse vast amounts of data from sensors embedded in machinery, production lines, and supply chains, predicting potential issues before they occur and automatically adjusting processes to maintain optimal performance. Product design is revolutionised by data analytics, with AI systems capable of processing consumer preferences, market trends, and performance data to create innovative and perfectly tailored designs to consumer needs. This data-driven approach enables mass-customisation, where products can be personalised at scale without sacrificing production efficiency or increasing costs. Manufacturers use AI to simulate and optimise product designs before they reach the production stage, reducing the time and cost associated with prototyping.

Potentially, there could be a resurgence in demand for functional products that embody superior quality and durability, with industries that once relied heavily on mass production shifting towards low-volume, high-quality manufacturing processes. Researchers and engineers focus on developing new alloys, composites, and bio-inspired materials that are not only stronger and lighter but also more environmentally friendly, such as being entirely degradable. In this scenario, developing smart materials that adapt to environmental conditions or have self-healing properties enables an enhanced lifespan, biocompatibility and performance, and reduced waste.

This fragmentation increases operational costs and complicates cross-border operations. Manufacturing companies must navigate different regions’ diverse environmental and safety regulations, leading to higher compliance costs and operational complexity. Manufacturers focus on improving internal efficiencies and developing adaptable compliance strategies to counter these inefficiencies. Hence, by 2030, the manufacturing sector will be characterised by a relentless focus on efficiency. This scenario emerges from increasing global competition, resource scarcity, and the need to reduce environmental impact. Manufacturers prioritise streamlined operations, waste reduction, and optimal resource utilisation, leading to a lean and highly efficient production environment. Efficiency-driven manufacturing also influences product design. Products are engineered for easy manufacturing, using fewer components and materials without compromising quality. This scenario results in faster production cycles, lower costs, and a reduced environmental footprint, making efficiency the critical competitive advantage in the future manufacturing sector.

However, after World War II, an era of globalisation and free trade eased many trade barriers. This trend was reversed after 2018. The US triggered a trade war against China to reduce the bilateral trade deficit and stop Chinese companies’ subjective unfair trade practices, such as violations of intellectual property rights and forced technology transfer.8 Initially framed as a battle against unfair economic practices, the trade war has since morphed into a more complex geopolitical struggle. The Biden administration has largely continued the policies, emphasising a competitive stance against China. This includes tariffs and restrictions on high-tech exports and investments, reflecting a growing concern over national security and technological dominance. The economic ramifications of the trade war are profound and multifaceted. T ariffs have led to increased costs for consumers and businesses in both countries.9 The implications of a trade war extend beyond the US and China. It has created ripples throughout the global economy, affecting countries that are part of the supply chain and those reliant on exports to these two economic giants. Trade wars will hurt the whole world’s manufacturing employment.10 For example, Southeast Asian nations have seen shifts in trade patterns as companies relocate production to avoid tariffs. Similarly, the trading relationship between the EU and China has become increasingly contentious.11 This conflict is characterised by tariffs, investigations, and retaliatory measures significantly affecting economies and the broader global market. Historically, the EU and China have maintained a complex trading relationship. The European Union is one of China’s largest trading partners, with a significant trade deficit favouring China. In 2022, the EU’s trade deficit in goods with China was nearly €300 billion, prompting calls within the EU to address perceived imbalances and unfair trade practices. The EU has accused China of dumping products below market value and providing unfair subsidies to its industries, leading to investigations into various sectors, including steel, electric vehicles, and luxury goods. Recently, the EU imposed tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs). This action responded to concerns that Chinese EVs were sold at artificially low prices, undermining European manufacturers.12 China quickly retaliated, threatening to impose tariffs on European agricultural products, particularly pork and dairy, which are significant exports for several EU member states, including Spain and Ireland. The economic ramifications of this trade war are profound. The tariffs on Chinese goods for the EU protect local industries and encourage fair competition. European manufacturing companies that rely on Chinese components may face higher production costs, which could ultimately lead to increased prices for consumers. The EU-China trade war is a complex and evolving issue that poses significant challenges for both regions. As tariffs and retaliatory measures escalate, the potential for economic disruption increases, affecting consumers and businesses alike. On this tipping point, the outcome of this conflict will not only shape the future of EU-China relations but also have far-reaching implications for the global economy. Both sides must navigate these tensions carefully to avoid a protracted conflict that could reshape international trade dynamics and economic alliances in the near future. In addition to the two trade wars mentioned, the impact of EU sanctions on Russia, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has been significant and multifaceted since their implementation in February 2022. The EU has imposed extensive sanctions, including export bans on critical goods and technologies, which have affected approximately one-third of the tot", "char_len": 5573}

Despite these declines, overall manufacturing output in Russia has not decreased as dramatically as expected. By early 2023, manufacturing output was down only 1.7% year-on-year, indicating that specific sectors have suffered. In response to the sanctions, Russia has sought to adapt by increasing imports from non-sanctioning countries, which have filled some gaps left by the EU’s restrictions. Countries such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, and Armenia have become significant trade partners, facilitating the re-routing of goods into Russia. For example, imports of mobile phones and computers from these countries surged as Russian manufacturers sought alternatives to banned Western products.15 The EU sanctions have profoundly affected Russian manufacturing, leading to significant declines in specific sectors and prompting trade pattern adaptations. The immediate consequences have been severe. However, Russia’s ability to maintain some level of manufacturing output through alternative trade routes suggests a complex and evolving economic landscape. The long-term implications of these sanctions is likely to continue to shape the future of Russian manufacturing and its overall economic resilience.16 Their share of global trade in developing countries has increased, rising from about 22% in 1964 to approximately 44% by 202317 (see Figure 5). Several factors, including tariff liberalisation and integrating national economies into global value chains, have driven this growth. Developing economies, particularly in Asia, have become key players in international trade, benefiting from their ability to produce and export manufactured goods at competitive prices.19 While tariffs have decreased globally, the rise of non-tariff measures (NTMs), such as quotas and stringent safety standards, poses new barriers to trade. NTMs are policy measures, other than ordinary customs tariffs, which can economically affect international trade in goods, changing quantities traded, prices, or both. These measures disproportionately affect developing countries;20 while tariffs have fallen, non-tariff measures have risen, creating new trade challenges for developing countries.21 Economic decoupling Decoupling can reduce trade volumes and product affordability, increase tariffs and investment restrictions from international markets, and create a market crisis.22 Rapid globalisation has created interdependencies, vulnerabilities and power imbalances across economies. This can pressure supply chain nodes, creating a ‘decoupling’23 or complete economic disentanglement between economies. An example of this is the rivalry between China and the US (who account for 40% of global GDP), where both nations leverage technological dependencies to vie for geopolitical dominance and improved national security, marking a significant shift away from the international norms of free trade and open borders. As a result, interdependence has accelerated economic decoupling, with the COVID-19 pandemic further driving countries to prioritise economic self- reliance and resilience. China is the US’s primary trading partner, holding approximately US$860 billion in debt (as of January 2023)24. Recently, this has shifted the US’s Figure 5 Trade share of developing countries on par with developed countries18World trade in goods surges, with a growing share for developing countries Total merchandise trade, millions of dollars at current prices, 1948-2023 Developed economies 25 000 000 20 000 000 15 000 000 10 000 000 5 000 000 0 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020Developing economies World Manufacturing Report 2024 23focus from decoupling to de-risking, where strategies are based on proactively recognising threats.

On the flipside, however, the economic decoupling between the US and China has benefited emerging countries.29 For instance, global diversification of critical supply chains has increased foreign investments for setting up semiconductor manufacturing hubs in Malaysia, with US$13.5 billion invested in 2023. China has also begun its diversification strategy by establishing businesses in Mexico, Eastern Europe and Latin America. China made a US$1 billion investment with Canada to mine Argentina’s lithium reserves and increase the country’s monopoly on critical raw materials to manufacture green technologies. Geographically advantaged countries that possess a skilled workforce, invest in upskilling and have abundant reserves of critical raw materials are likely to attract global financial investments. These nations stand to emerge as economic leaders if they can leverage these strengths as safeguards against potential economic risks from future decoupling scenarios. Cyberattacks The manufacturing sector is experiencing a rapid rise in cyberattacks, driven by increasing digitalisation and the integration of advanced technologies. Cyberattacks on manufacturing companies have become a more substantial risk, and the overall cost of security measures has recently increased significantly. A tipping point towards a permanent disadvantage is imminent. Recent reports indicate that nearly 40% of manufacturers encounter cyber incidents annually, with ransomware attacks on industrial infrastructure almost doubling in 2022. Notably, 70% of surveyed companies that suffered ransomware attacks were in manufacturing.30 SMEs are especially vulnerable to cyberattacks due to smaller security budgets. Still, large manufacturing companies are more attractive to targeted attacks due to the higher amount of ransom money extracted.31 World Manufacturing Report 2024 24Ransomware payments in 2023 surpassed the US$1 billion mark, the highest number ever observed.32 As manufacturers adopt smart factory initiatives and the Internet of Things (IoT), they inadvertently expand their attack surfaces, making them prime targets for cybercriminals. Contributing factors to the heightened risk of cyberattacks in the manufacturing sector are the merging of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems, which creates vulnerabilities as both networks become interconnected, known as the IT- OT Convergence. This convergence blurs security lines, making it easier for attackers to exploit weaknesses. Other contributing factors are, for instance, legacy systems and a need for cybersecurity awareness. The consequences of these cyberattacks can be severe. Unauthorised access accounts for 87% of attacks, often leading to operational disruptions in 86% of cases. Due to ransomware attacks, 29% of the companies in the survey said they were forced to downsize and cut jobs.33 The impact of cyberattacks on manufacturing companies extends beyond immediate financial losses. Operational disruptions can halt production lines, leading to delays in product delivery and loss of customer trust. Manufacturing companies must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity to combat the growing cyberattack threat. Key strategies include recurring risk assessments, employee training, robust security measures, and an incident response plan. With the continued digitalisation of the manufacturing sector and rising global tensions, the risks associated with cyberattacks will increase further. Ransom money is individually priced for the targeted company according to financial statements. Therefore, an existential threat to manufacturing c", "char_len": 5810}

The demand for critical materials in the last five years was approximately US$320 billion and is expected to double in the next few years.35 However, geopolitical conflicts have intensified the need for critical materials compared to traditional minerals such as iron, aluminium and copper. Increasing geopolitical competition and export restrictions by resource-intensive countries lead to global economic disruptions. These are various forms of ‘resource nationalism’ , a term used for government involvement in the mining, processing, distributing and marketing of natural resources. It is a neutral concept and an economic initiative36 that can offer underdeveloped countries the chance to engage in the global division of labour and the sustainable supply of critical materials. Examples of resource nationalism can be seen in countries such as Zimbabwe, Indonesia, The Philippines and Chile, which progressively ban exports of unprocessed lithium and nickel ore, favouring domestic processing of these materials. Accordingly, resource nationalism can be seen in two forms: resource sub-nationalism and resource supra- nationalism.37 Resource sub-nationalism occurs locally, where governments in mineral-rich areas demand more outstanding shares of value, which could lead to conflict. Resource supra-nationalism, on the other hand, occurs when countries require access to globally scarce resources from resource-rich countries that are less powerful, thus leading to wars and supply chain disruptions. Non-economic factors such as resilience and security are now prioritised over economic and other market factors. Autonomous initiatives such as the EU’s Critical Raw Material Act (CRM Act)38 have combined reshoring strategies with cooperative diversifications, and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)39 has combined reshoring and ‘friend-shoring’ to improve trade and industrial partnerships outside orthodox political frameworks. The EU’s Green Deal has initiated decarbonisation efforts to address climate change. These 2050 net- zero targets will require a sustainable supply of critical materials. Additionally, these will weaken countries with fossil fuel reserves and strengthen countries with abundant renewable energy sources or those that can transform and distribute such sources. However, the ability of governments to adopt climate-related policies will ultimately determine their success in climate risk mitigation. Technological sovereignty Technological sovereignty can lead to developing and accelerating “local/national/regional” capabilities, new industries and sectors, product development, innovation, growth, and job creation. T echnological competition among nations and regions is intensifying, and the fear of falling behind in advancement World Manufacturing Report 2024 25has made technological sovereignty a worldwide concern. With growing geopolitical tensions, prolonged effects after the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing numbers of cyberattacks and the rise of derisking strategies, it has become a potent political theme worldwide to ensure technological sovereignty. Nations and regions increasingly recognise the importance of controlling their technological future to ensure safety, welfare, growth, and autonomy. T o be sovereign can generally be described as “having the highest power or being completely independent” .40 From a perspective of technological advancements, sovereignty can be understood as the ability to act autonomously and independently and to implement political and societal actions without being hindered by a lack of control over technology.41 Thus, technological sovereignty involves access to technology and relevant products or components that can be secured reliably through a nation’s capacity or its relations or alliance with other countries or regions.42 Digital sovereign", "char_len": 5876}

Thus, access to commodities, components, and knowledge is also part of technological sovereignty. Furthermore, the VDE use different fields of technology such as ICT, software, AI, automation, energy, medical technology, etc. and other application areas like automotive engineering, electronics and electrical engineering, energy supply and mechanical engineering to further elaborate on relevant aspects of technological sovereignty. The EU refers to six critical enabling technologies for Europe’s technological sovereignty: advanced manufacturing, advanced nanomaterials, life-science technologies, micro-/nano-electronics and photonics, AI, and security and connectivity technologies.47 The National Science and T echnology Council has published a list of critical and emerging technologies necessary for national security in the US.48 Accordingly, research and innovation policies are adopted to accelerate technological development and sovereignty worldwide.49 For manufacturing companies, developing advanced technologies, a reliable supply of critical materials and components, and stable access to critical infrastructure are necessary for long-term competitiveness. The race of countries to win technological sovereignty can be a significant tipping point for any manufacturing industry. Furthermore, manufacturing is vital for any nation or region seeking to develop, recover, or retain technological sovereignty. T echnological sovereignty can be considered high if a critical technology, including the necessary knowledge, competencies, components, and infrastructure, is produced and secured within a specific nation or region. This also includes the entire value chain required for the technology.50 Moreover, technologies enable industrial companies to extend the range of products and services offered, expanding global trade markets and increasing global investments and corresponding returns. While increased independence, innovation, security and growth are among the potential opportunities for manufacturing companies in the technological sovereignty race, challenges remain. Among the adverse effects are reduced access globally to new and critical technologies, reduced collaboration and innovation and reduced usage and implementation of promising new technologies and digital developments. Regulatory fragmentation The global patchwork of AI regulation is likely to become more complex in the future. Regulations and policies most often occur at a national or regional level. While nations and regions may decide to tackle critical global issues very differently, from climate change and global warming to AI and cybersecurity, differences in regulations can result in severe impacts on manufacturing companies. The race to develop and regulate new technologies and promote sustainability and circularity are highly relevant geopolitical themes. As a result, different regulations create a complex set of other conditions for manufacturing companies worldwide. Regulatory fragmentation – or regulatory divergence – can be defined in various ways depending on the type of regulation in focus. Often, regulatory or financial fragmentation is discussed in connection with the global economy and monetary system, referring to the situation where multiple regulatory entities create overlapping regulations, resulting in inconsistencies, inefficiencies and unclear objectives.51 A recent study concluded that regulatory fragmentation, redundancy, and inconsistency World Manufacturing Report 2024 26in the US – for instance, when multiple federal agencies oversee a single issue – increase the cost of manufac", "char_len": 6065}

Different national and regional conditions and goals broadly impact climate policies, sustainability regulations, and the adoption of reporting directives among countries. In the EU, the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were adopted in 2024 to be used by all companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). This is an example of global collaboration that can decrease the probability of policy and regulatory fragmentation, leading to a higher likelihood of combatting climate change. While governments worldwide promote the development of critical technologies to gain sovereignty, they are also tackling the issue of how to regulate new technologies best, especially AI, concerning national security.56 Many countries have national AI policies and policies applying to specific AI uses.57 The EU Parliament adopted the first EU regulatory framework for AI as part of the digital strategy (EU AI Act) in the Spring of 2024, while the US has released various frameworks and guidelines related to AI, including the executive order on the safe, secure and trustworthy development and use of AI.58 In 2017, China announced the AI Development Plan and has several national-level policy documents for AI regulation and governance.59 The EY 2024 Geostrategic Outlook Report mentions the dual race of developing AI and regulating AI as one of the cornerstones of AI’s geopolitics, which is expected to accelerate and harden geopolitical blocks. For manufacturing, differences in policies regarding the development and regulation of AI and new technologies can significantly impact competitive conditions and create favourable environments in some industries and nations compared to others. Economic tipping points The global manufacturing sector faces potential economic tipping points that could drive innovation and growth or lead to disruptions and decline. Understanding these tipping points is essential for policymakers, business leaders, and other stakeholders who must navigate this complex landscape to ensure the sector’s long-term viability and competitiveness. Obsolescence of manufacturing business and operating models Due to rapid technological advancements, traditional manufacturing businesses and operating models must be updated, making innovation essential for maintaining competitiveness. The obsolescence of traditional manufacturing businesses and operating models is the most significant economic tipping point facing the sector today. This phenomenon is closely linked to the broader shift towards Industry 4.0, which involves the integration of advanced technologies such as automation, digitisation, and interconnected systems. These technologies are transforming the foundation of manufacturing businesses, leading to a fundamental change in how value is created, delivered, and captured in the market. Historically, manufacturing companies have focused on incremental growth through product improvement and market expansion. This approach, however, is increasingly unsustainable in the face of stagnating economic development, global disruptions, and diminishing returns from traditional methods. Manufacturers who fail to innovate beyond product-centric strategies risk being outpaced by more agile competitors who are better equipped to navigate the complexities of the modern market.60 This potential for widespread industry disruption underscores why the obsolescence of traditional models is seen as a foundational economic tipping point. It affects every aspect of the manufacturing process, from supply World Manufacturing Report 2024 27chain management to production efficiency and market competitiveness. Moreover, the need for business model innovation in manufacturing is becoming more urgent as environmental considerations, customer expectations, and regulatory pressures intensify.

This trend is reshaping the global manufacturing landscape and altering the economic calculus of production. China, once the go-to destination for low-cost manufacturing, has seen significant wage inflation over the past decade. This trend is reaching an economic tipping point where manufacturing in China is no longer as cost effective as it once was. In response, companies like Foxconn, a major supplier for Apple, have started to automate production lines and shift some operations to lower-cost regions such as Vietnam and India.61 This move highlights the growing importance of ‘automation’ in maintaining cost competitiveness and underscores the shifting dynamics of global manufacturing hubs. The rise of automation is a tipping point that could reduce the reliance on human labour and shift the economic benefits of manufacturing from labour-intensive regions to those with advanced technological infrastructure. The widespread adoption of robotics in manufacturing, particularly in industries like automotive and electronics, is accelerating this shift. However, the balance between automation and cost effectiveness is complex. For instance, in 2018, Adidas announced the closure of its highly automated “Speedfactory” facilities in Germany and the US, citing inefficiencies and the high automation costs compared to traditional methods.62 This case illustrates manufacturers’ challenges as they navigate the tipping point between labour costs and automation. The implications of wage inflation and automation extend beyond cost considerations. As companies increasingly rely on automation, there is a risk of significant job displacement, which could lead to social and economic challenges in regions heavily dependent on manufacturing jobs. Policymakers and business leaders must carefully manage this transition to ensure that the benefits of automation are broadly shared and that workers are equipped with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly automated world. Rise of raw material commodity prices Fluctuating raw material costs and resource scarcity threaten manufacturing viability, prompting a shift to alternative materials and more resilient supply chains. Raw material costs have always been a critical factor in manufacturing. Still, recent fluctuations have highlighted their potential to reach a tipping point where they jeopardise the economic viability of specific processes and products. The increasing scarcity of critical raw materials, driven by geopolitical tensions, environmental regulations, and supply chain disruptions, can lead to significant cost increases that could have far-reaching implications for the manufacturing sector. The 2007-2008 global financial crisis saw a sharp increase in the prices of essential commodities like oil and metals, which strained manufacturing margins worldwide.63 Manufacturing companies were forced to either absorb the costs, thereby reducing profitability, or pass them on to consumers, potentially reducing demand. The tipping point occurs when these costs reach a level where traditional manufacturing becomes economically unfeasible, prompting a shift towards alternative materials or localised sourcing strategies. Resource depletion, particularly of rare-earth elements critical for electronics, presents another economic tipping point. The scarcity of these materials has spurred innovation in recycling and the development of synthetic alternatives. However, this also increases costs and potential disruptions in established manufacturing processes. For example, the push for electric vehicles (EVs) has driven up the demand for lithium and cobalt, leading to price surges and supply chain bottlenecks. These challenges underscore the importance of securing sustainable and resilient supply chains for critical raw materials. The global semiconductor shortage in 2020-2021, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic, is a stark reminde", "char_len": 5879}

Energy price volatility can severely impact the cost structure of manufacturing operations. For instance, during the 1970s oil crisis, many manufacturers faced existential threats due to skyrocketing fuel costs.65 More recently, the shale gas revolution in the US provided a reprieve, lowering energy costs and boosting domestic manufacturing. However, reliance on fossil fuels poses long-term risks as regulatory changes and market dynamics shift towards renewable energy. The transition to green energy presents challenges and opportunities for the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers that proactively invest in energy-efficient technologies and renewable energy sources can gain a competitive advantage. For example, Siemens has significantly reduced its carbon footprint by investing in renewable energy and energy-efficient production processes. Conversely, manufacturing companies that are slow to adapt may find themselves at a tipping point where rising carbon taxes or regulatory penalties erode profitability. In addition to regulatory pressures, consumer demand for environmentally sustainable products drives the transition to green energy. Manufacturing companies that align their operations with these expectations can differentiate themselves in the market, while those that fail to do so risk losing market share. This dynamic creates a tipping point where the costs of inaction outweigh the investments required to transition to green energy. Rise of logistics costs and supply chain risks Rising transportation costs, regulatory changes, and supply chain disruptions force manufacturers to reconsider global supply chains and shift towards more localised production models.Rising fuel prices, regulatory changes, and infrastructure challenges can lead to a tipping point where traditional global supply chains become economically unsustainable. This shift could force manufacturing companies to rethink their supply chain strategies and explore more localised production models. Rising fuel costs directly impact transportation expenses, which in turn affect the overall cost structure of manufacturing. Changes in transportation regulations, such as stricter emissions standards, can further increase logistics costs. Implementing the International Maritime Organisation’s (IMO) 2020 regulations, which required ships to use low-sulphur fuel, significantly increased shipping costs.66 These regulatory changes are reaching a tipping point where traditional global supply chains may no longer be economically viable, leading to a reconfiguration of manufacturing networks. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of global supply chains, as lockdowns and transport restrictions led to significant disruptions. This situation highlighted the need for more resilient and flexible supply chains, with many manufacturing companies exploring near- shoring or reshoring strategies to reduce dependence on long-distance transportation. As manufacturers re- evaluate their supply chain strategies, the rising costs of transportation and logistics will play a crucial role in shaping the future of global manufacturing. Shifts in global demand patterns The growth of emerging markets and the expanding middle class are changing global demand, forcing manufacturers to adapt their strategies and production locations. The global demand landscape is shifting, with emerging markets playing an increasingly significant role. As these markets grow, they are reaching tipping points that could fundamentally alter global manufacturing strategies. The rapid growth of emerging markets such as India, China, and Southeast Asia has shifted the focus of global manufacturing, with companies increasingly tailoring their strategies to serve these growing consumer bases. The expansion of the global middle class, particularly in Asia, is creating new demand patterns that are reaching a tipping point. Most glob", "char_len": 5848}

However, those who need to adapt to these shifting demand patterns risk being left behind in an increasingly competitive global market. Global economic slowdown Economic slowdowns trigger demand shocks, leading to overcapacity and industry contraction. This necessitates strategic fiscal and monetary responses to stabilise the sector. A global recession or economic slowdown represents a significant tipping point that could lead to overcapacity in the manufacturing sector, forcing manufacturing companies to cut back production, close facilities, or even go bankrupt. The 2008 global financial crisis is a stark reminder of how a severe economic slowdown can lead to a tipping point in the manufacturing sector. The collapse in consumer demand during the 2008 crisis led to significant overcapacity, particularly in the automotive and electronics sectors, forcing many manufacturing companies to downsize or shut down operations. This experience underscores the manufacturing sector’s vulnerability to demand shocks, which can have cascading effects on supply chains, employment, and overall economic stability. The COVID-19 pandemic similarly triggered a demand shock, leading to sudden and severe disruptions in manufacturing output. The pandemic led to a collapse in demand for non-essential goods, causing significant challenges for manufacturers worldwide. The tipping point occurred when supply chains collapsed, requiring substantial government intervention and restructuring of the sector. John Maynard Keynes’ theory of aggregate demand provides a valuable framework for understanding the impact of demand shocks on the manufacturing sector.68 According to Keynes, a sudden drop in aggregate demand can lead to a vicious cycle of reduced production, job losses, and further declines in demand, creating a tipping point where the entire sector contracts. Policymakers must be prepared to respond to such tipping points with appropriate fiscal and monetary measures to prevent long-term damage to the manufacturing sector. Social tipping points Global social trends are reshaping societal structures and transforming jobs. The international manufacturing sector must understand these social shifts and prepare for a new generation of workers. Workforce demographics Significant social transformations in workforce demographics include declining fertility rates, which contribute to workforce shortages; increasing urbanisation, which alters the workforce profile; and the growing participation of women in the job market, which reshapes workforce composition. World demographics rapidly shift, presenting significant social challenges directly affecting the manufacturing sector. Fundamental changes include an ageing workforce, generational differences, geographic redistribution, and increasing gender diversity. According to the United Nations69, the global population is expected to grow by 2 billion, from 7.7 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050, eventually peaking at nearly 11 billion by the end of the century as fertility rates continue to decline. Projections indicate that by 2050, 76% of countries worldwide will have fertility rates below the population replacement level.70 Figure 7 illustrates current fertility rates, highlighting most countries’ widening gap between younger and older generations.71 As a result, the population and the labour force available for manufacturing are becoming increasingly older. The labour-intensive competitive advantage some countries have historically enjoyed due to higher fertility rates is diminishing, as seen in China and India, producing workforce shortages. This change has raised the prospect of labour-intensive manufacturing relocating to Africa, the only continent where fertility rates remain high, potentially providing a young workforce for the future.72 However, the widening generational gap in the manufacturing sector poses significan", "char_len": 5650}

Emerging economies fall in between, with the lowest female labour participation rates.76 In this context, gender diversity remains a challenge for the manufacturing sector, where women constitute only about 30% of the workforce in the US and Europe. This new reality creates a new workforce composition for the future of manufacturing. This significant shift towards urban living began less than 20 years ago, and urbanisation continues to accelerate, as illustrated in Figure 8. This trend presents another irreversible change that affects how manufacturing activity will be shaped. As workers become more urbanised, they encounter the complexities of urban life, which are often linked to increased anxiety, depression, and difficulties in achieving work-life balance. Consequently, manufacturing will need to address not only productivity concerns but also the emotional wellbeing of its workforce. Additionally, the proximity of urban workers to a diverse job market may lead to higher job mobility, potentially increasing turnover rates within the manufacturing sector.Figure 7 Fertility rates worldwide (Source: World Bank, 2024) Figure 8 Share of the world’s population living in urban or rural areas (Source: Statista, 2024)70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 1960 1992 1976 2008 1968 2000 1984 2016 1964 1996 1980 2012 1972 2004 1988 2020 1962 1994 1978 2010 1970 2002 1986 2018 1966 1998 1982 2014 1974 2006 1990 2022Share of global popu lation Urban population Rural population World Manufacturing Report 2024 31Skills gaps More workers are needed with the in-demand skills necessary to transform the manufacturing sector sustainably. Due to society’s changing needs, skills gaps have widened and could soon lead to significant shifts in industry. Industrial transformations and technological advancements have significantly disrupted industries throughout history, altering the nature of work, the tasks performed, and the skills required. While these shifts have ultimately led to greater productivity, wealth, and wellbeing, such benefits are only realised when essential intangibles, like skills, are developed alongside new technologies. Introducing (new) technologies and setting new goals, particularly in manufacturing, can result in a productivity slowdown – also known as the productivity paradox.77 This occurs when a mismatch between business needs and the workforce’s skills creates skills gaps that hinder progress.78 Moreover, demographic trends indicate a shrinking workforce, exacerbating challenges and leading to significant consequences. T oday, the manufacturing sector faces enormous challenges, ranging from the aftereffects of the pandemic to technological disruption and the green transition. A workforce that meets the demands of a competitive and sustainably growing industry is crucial for a functioning economy and society. The manufacturing sector needs a skilled workforce to maximise the benefits of technological advancements like artificial intelligence. However, the manufacturing sector today faces huge skills gaps and skills shortages, resulting in a slowdown or even stagnation in the transformation towards adopting new technologies needed to improve manufacturing systems’ resilience, sustainability, and human-centricity. Worldwide, 1.1 billion jobs are liable to be transformed by new technologies.79 Within the advanced manufacturing sector alone, 29.9 million people are employed, and their jobs are impacted mainly by the implications of the green transition, the implementation of ESG factors, changing consumer behaviours, and the adoption of new technologies.80 It is expected that around 44% of employees’ skills will have to change, and the need for cognitive skills is growing the most.81 However, only around 40% of adults upskill themselves yearly82, even though many of their current tasks will disappear and new ones will be necessar", "char_len": 5481}

However, in a rapidly evolving world, it is increasingly difficult for individuals to identify which skills are essential to acquire and develop. With the current environmental crisis, the industry’s priorities are shifting, and green innovation needs to be enabled. Hence, green skills have become increasingly important. Green skills are “skills required to adapt products, services or operations to meet adjustments, requirements or regulations designed to stem further climate change or adapt to the impact it already has” .86 While the commitment of individuals and industrial leaders is still too low to tackle the green skills gaps, the European Commission is pushing for a Green and Digital transformation (see Figure 10). In the past, changing requirements have led to fear among workers of losing their jobs, realising that some of their tasks and skills are becoming obsolete. Looking at this from an evolutionary perspective, this fear stems from the survival instinct we humans have – we naturally want to stick to what is known, what we have experienced as functioning and safe.87 This implies a particular difficulty in supporting employees through change management. A lack of inner motivation and transformational skills hinders people from adopting green practices. According to a study by the Inner Development Goals Foundation, these skills are “Being, Thinking, Relating, Collaborating, and Acting” (see Figure 11).

As an effect, this could increase the polarisation of society and put more fire into the arguments of radical groups. Society is close to a tipping point where it is about creating pathways accessible for everyone and leading to a workforce strong enough to work towards a sustainable industry or risk losing large numbers of people to unemployment and creating large societal instabilities. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set as directions to lead the world towards a sustainable future and prevent catastrophes. The SDGs “Decent Work and Economic Growth” and “Reduced Inequalities” highlight that employment and equal opportunities for all are needed to ensure a healthy and safe society. Unemployment leads to frustration and an increase in mental health disorders and suicide rates. However, skills gaps in manufacturing can also lead to a tipping point for supply chains that rely on basic human needs. The lack of skilled workers who can produce the products society needs can lead to more supply chain disruptions, which can majorly affect society, mainly when critical goods, raw materials, or products are not delivered. From an economic perspective, skills gaps can lead to a decline in specific manufacturing sectors or even erase them. This would result from many reasons, all stemming from a loss of productivity and growth. Manufacturing companies need talented people to develop creative ideas, create innovative technologies, build sustainable solutions, and have a resilient and human-centric organisation. T o do that, those people need to have the right skills.

The skills gaps in the manufacturing sector can lead to social inequalities, especially between those without access to education. Those with access to quality education can ensure they remain relevant in a changing environment with new requirements. However, people need access to educational resources to have the opportunity to follow the changes in the job market and eventually risk losing their jobs. This results in rising unemployment rates, more World Manufacturing Report 2024 33hours, at 47.6 hours. As a result, manufacturing workers are more prone to health issues and dissatisfaction in their personal lives, with limited time to pursue individual goals.89 Organisations focused on improving work quality argue that these long hours must be reduced to prevent irreversible social issues, as seen in recent years with the rise of anxiety and depression in several societies. Achieving a work-life balance model for manufacturing is a positive social tipping point that would create new work models focused on reducing the collateral effects of the current reality of work in manufacturing. In this sense, new perspectives have been proposed, including topics like human-centric manufacturing, industrial smart-working environments, and Industry 5.0, as models that can better integrate workers with technology and the organisation and provide better work models to create a more balanced work-life approach. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) Increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion can help overcome workers’ marginalisation and create a better environment. DEI can also foster creativity and innovation. Focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the manufacturing sector has become increasingly crucial for future growth. In 2020, the global expenditure on DEI initiatives by companies (including those in the manufacturing sector) totalled US$7.5 billion, and there are projections that these investments will rise significantly, reaching US$15.4 billion by 2026.90 Despite the previous efforts to include DEI as a critical business driver, the current rate of progress is still slow.91,92 DEI- related advances vary among companies, industries, and countries. However, one inconvenient truth is that the manufacturing sector still lags in DEI, positing it as a tipping point.

As shown in Figure 14, only one-third of workers in the US manufacturing sector are women, while other minorities (for example, Asian and Latinx employees) have better representation.93 Another study confirms the gender gap, with women comprising just 26% of all workers in the UK manufacturing sector. Additionally, only 5% of jobs are held by ethnic groups, and only 2% of manufacturers have an average workforce under 30.94 In developing countries, generational, gender, and racial disparities also persist as well, where the representation of these groups remains significantly lower than that of their male counterparts.95 Moreover, Figure 14 shows that women and ethnic minorities frequently encounter disparities in wages, career progression, and promotions. Women generally earn about 20% less than their male counterparts, and promotion rates are also lower, as they are 20% less likely to advance.96 Ethnic minorities face even more significant obstacles. Only 18% of the Latinx workforce has access to formal career development programmes, and just 41% of the Black workforce is satisfied with their career progression rates in the US industry sector.

Increased attention to DEI is necessary because it is the right thing to do and because imperatives are pushing the manufacturing sector. Some of them are related to demographic changes (ageing, racial justice, gender equality activism), consumer change behaviour (concerns about ethical practices), regulatory pressures (related to workplace diversity), and economic reasons. In this case, a study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group highlights that companies with higher levels of diversity experience innovation revenue that is 19% greater compared to companies with less diverse leadership.100 Moreover, manufacturers with proactive DEI strategies have experienced increased productivity, better workforce motivation, and enhanced competitive advantage, as shown in Figure 15.101 World Manufacturing Report 2024 35 Changes in consumer behaviour Societal values are shifting, and there is a growing concern for sustainable behaviour. As a result, consumers increasingly demand greater social responsibility from manufacturers in the marketplace.

Considering all the results, manufacturers should make green choices more accessible and appealing to customers (for example, making sustainable claims). In doing this, they can close the gap between consumer intentions and spending. Furthermore, McKinsey reveals that over 70% of consumers expect personalised experiences with products, services, and brands, demonstrating frustration when companies fail. Moreover, personalisation is particularly critical for younger generations, such as Millennials and Gen Z, who are already accustomed to individualised experiences.104 However, although personalisation appears crucial, it does not ensure complete engagement, as brand exploration is another trend in consumer behaviour. Thus, Millennials and Gen Z are prone to exploring new brands and are five times more likely than older generations to believe that newer brands offer better or more innovative products than established ones.105 Technological tipping points Is this the time to make or break? Evolution or revolution? Global manufacturing is under pressure amidst the grand manufacturing challenges and technological tipping points. Enlarging industrial technological applications Advances and adoption of new (deep) technologies are facilitating the achievement of new process efficiencies in the manufacturing sector.Digitalisation has led to the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and new (deep) technologies have changed the manufacturing landscape of possibilities. Manufacturers’ resources are technologically optimised to create further avenues of opportunities. This has impacted previous design theories, existing designs, and how we perceive future designs to look, which have been revolutionised. Many studies have shown that smart systems have produced greater monetary benefits and provided a competitive advantage for manufacturing companies. However, if this fast-paced change is sustainable, reducing World Manufacturing Report 2024 36On November 30th, 2022, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the public, ushering in the debate on generative AI (GenAI) and its diverse applications. Industrial AI has been scrutinised for years but is increasingly considered and applied in practical production. AI-driven systems are increasingly involved in decision-making processes in manufacturing, from design and prototyping to production and quality control. AI can optimise production processes, predict maintenance needs (predictive maintenance), and improve supply chain management, leading to increased efficiency. It can also enable “smart factories, ” where AI continually optimises production systems. In literature, one of the primary reasons for implementing smart digitalisation through artificial intelligence (AI) in business models is to achieve mass customisation of products110 and services; however, integrating technology innovation with smart business models is complex111 and creates energy, resource intensity, emissions, and waste per production unit can be prioritised.106 Scientists have agreed that ‘sustainable innovations’ create novelty regarding technology, processes, procedures, and practices involved in business models.107 Figure 16 shows the significant impact of IoT, AI, and cloud technologies on businesses.108 The number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the world is forecast to almost double from 20.1 billion in 2025 to more than 39.6 billion IoT devices in 2033.109 The widespread adoption of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where nearly every factory machine, sensor, and the process is connected and communicating in real time, is a game-changer.

They have greater flexibility and adaptability than conventional solutions, which enables them to perform more complex and precise tasks at scale. World Manufacturing Report 2024 37Applying advanced robots and automated systems can result in increased productivity, higher consistency in quality, better ergonomics, and reduced labour costs. The manufacturing sector increasingly employs collaborative robots (cobots) working alongside human employees on factory floors, particularly for robotic automation. Cobots can perform repetitive and physically demanding tasks, allowing human workers to concentrate on more complex, creative, or decision-making roles. Cobots could enhance productivity, reduce workplace injuries, and lead to a more integrated human-machine work environment. However, increasing usage of robots and other automated systems could also lead to significant workforce changes, requiring reskilling and rethinking human roles in manufacturing. Factories with more autonomous systems are becoming more realistic possibilities with AI, intelligent robots, and IIoT systems integrated, and they can operate with minimal human oversight. These factories can maximise efficiency, reduce human error, and operate continuously without downtime. While this could lead to cost savings and increased production capacity, it may also lead to significant challenges related to workforce displacement and the need for highly specialised technical skills. The increasing automation in manufacturing will require an adaptable workforce equipped with the necessary technical skills to operate and maintain these advanced systems. Global competition in the manufacturing sector intensifies, compelling a departure from traditional systems to meet new sustainability demands. This necessitates adapting durable industrial products to the principles of a circular economy, presenting the industry with various challenges. A pivotal challenge lies in the necessity to develop new materials possessing enhanced mechanical and sustainable properties, thus propelling the industry towards advanced manufacturing processes underpinned by Industry 4.0 technologies. These technologies facilitate the production of high-tech and intricate products while concurrently mitigating environmental impact. Additive manufacturing (3D printing), robotics, edge computing, and machine learning (ML) have substantially transformed the manufacturing landscape. These innovations redefine product conceptualisation, manufacturing, and delivery, offering heightened customisation, precision, and efficiency. As contemporary manufacturing objectives grow increasingly intricate, traditional approaches necessitate revision, prompting enterprises to adopt novel and innovative strategies. Additive manufacturing bears the potential to revolutionise the large-scale production of end-use parts across diverse industries, heralding a wave of optimism. This shift can revolutionise supply chains through localised, on-demand manufacturing, waste reduction, and the facilitation of highly personalised products. Conventional manufacturing processes, such as injection moulding, may experience diminished demand, while industries like aerospace, automotive, and healthcare benefit from the ability to fabricate complex, lightweight components. Additive manufacturing also allows the creation of highly customised and intricate products with complex geometries, incorporating elements from varied materials and embedded electronics, optics, or photonics. Despite offering an extensive range of design potentials, these products introduce challenges in terms of circularity and sustainability. However, additive manufacturing addresses some of these challenges by curbing material waste, reducing energy consumption, and supporting on- demand production, thereby significantly diminishing the environmental fo", "char_len": 6381}

Rising digital and green economy There is a need for more governance systems as part of the digital economy. An irreversible decentralised open database is created by blockchains, a new technological innovation that utilises peer-to-peer computing plus cryptography. A blockchain is a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, where the ledger maintains cash, but its entries may contain any information structure, encompassing ownership rights, identification and accreditation, agreements, etc. It is believed that the financial implications of blockchains embrace an expanded perspective of blockchains as an organisational technological advance, extending beyond the examination of new general-purpose technology and its destructive Schumpeterian consequences. How we own the asset is the new economy. According to the research argument, blockchains are an example of institutional change.114 Five distinctive principles of blockchain are peer-to-peer transmission, immutability of record, computational logic, transparency with pseudonymity, and a distributed database. Decentralised Finance (DeFi), Cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible T okens (NFTs), Gaming and decentralised Finance (GameFi), and a blockchain-based metaverse are all applications of Blockchain. Disintermediation is the crucial idea of decentralisation. No single party controls the entire network, thus enhancing the distribution of power and authority, autonomy, and resilience. Decentralisation eradicates ‘middlemen’ or components from a transactional or supply chain. It entails eliminating pointless middlemen to create a closer relationship between manufacturers and consumers. The manufacturing sector widely adopts blockchain, AI-driven analytics, and real-time tracking in supply chain management. These technologies can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in supply chains. Manufacturers could achieve better product traceability, reduce counterfeiting, and optimise logistics, leading to faster, more reliable delivery of goods. The current literature has forecast the growth of blockchain technology in business, primarily in information systems and management. However, it has yet to identify efficient application instances that could capture the curiosity of a wider population. Most blockchain research alludes to the system’s features that affect how trust emerges in commerce. A Green Deal to become “clean” – the race for clean energy. European industry accounts for about 20% of European greenhouse gas emissions. According to the EU Green Deal in 2019, it was decided that Europe will become carbon-neutral by 2050. The European Green Deal generates significant demand in the market for sustainable solutions.

Circularity and sustainability by design as adoption drivers. Manufacturers are forced to rethink their production methods with circular economy objectives to ensure the sustainability of durable industrial products. These new sustainability requirements demand that manufacturing systems be highly efficient and capable of extending product lifespan through better lifecycle management and monitoring while adhering to circular principles. As a result, international manufacturing must adopt flexible, transparent, trustworthy, efficient, and cybersecurity systems. Developing novel materials with enhanced mechanical properties and sustainability features pushes the industry to explore highly digitalised and circular processes covering the entire lifecycle. Enabling technologies like big data analytics, IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), energy and resource management, AI optimisations, Digital twins and simulations allow manufacturers to achieve effective and efficient systems while reducing environmental impacts. Using simulations and the industrial metaverse can drastically cut down the resources needed to create working prototypes, helping to save both energy and materials long before production even starts. By generating synthetic data instead of running machines for extended periods, companies can quickly gather the data required for training, cutting energy and material usage while validating AI systems with 70% less computing power. According to Accenture116, these advancements could save an impressive US$131 billion in raw material costs, reduce product development expenses by US$6 billion, and lower embedded product CO2 footprints by 281 million metric tons, all thanks to better lifecycle assessment (LCA) visibility and smarter decision-making. The study also found that adopting digital twins across more industries could unlock up to US$1.3 trillion in economic value and reduce CO2 emissions by 7.5 gigatons by 2030. A vital aspect of the digital and green economy is the ability to integrate real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making into manufacturing processes. Digital twin technologies provide virtual representations of physical systems, allowing manufacturers to monitor and optimise production processes in real time, leading to more significant sustainability gains. These gains come in the form of reduced waste, lower energy consumption, and the ability to extend the lifecycle of products through better maintenance, reuse, and recycling practices. In addition, adopting Sustainability by Design (SbD) practices by collecting data from the entire product lifecycle will boost production sustainability and circularity. In Europe, initiatives such as Digital Product Passport (DPP) will become a game-changer as it will be mandatory for the Batteries and T extiles industries, with more industries to follow. DPP is a tool for collecting and sharing data on products’ value chain aiming to enhance sustainable production, fuel value-chain sustainability, advance to a circular economy, illustrate environmental and recyclability attributes, generate new economic prospects, aid consumers in opting sustainably, enable authorities to ensure legal conformity, etc. Furthermore, big data analytics offers valuable insights into reducing carbon emissions and cost-saving measures.

This change necessitates considering the confrontation of humans and machines. According to the Human-AI technology report, AI is a form of extremely capable automation directed at highly perceptual and cognitive tasks.117 The team performance in human-AI interaction depends on automation levels, autonomy, and the stage of knowledge-worker interaction. We must better understand political economy, cultural production, and AI’s role in cultural democracy and relativism. Innovation managers use tools like ChatGPT to navigate these complexities, balancing task automation while enhancing human creativity. They must ensure AI integration supports business goals while fostering creative growth and respecting cultural dynamics.According to Fusion Skills, hybrid activities are performed by both humans and machines. Figure 19 compares human and machine hybrid activities proposed by Daugherty and Wilson.118 On the one hand, we see the benefits of humans complementing machines by rehumanising time (reuse time saved by machines), responsible normalising (sustaining process/activities) and judgement integration (decision-making). Whereas, when AI gives human superpowers, it is done by extracting insights through AI by intelligent interrogation, extending the capabilities of AI systems through bots. For instance, it could be an automated scheduling agent by Clara Labs and holistic melding, where models are made to reimagine a company’s business. The development of new skills continues with reciprocal apprenticing in humans and machines. This is an iterative and cyclical process. Both learn from each other. This process continues again by reimagining new models from scratch and so the process is repeated. The degree of automation implemented in various functional task stages can significantly affect human workers’ performance, with potential beneficial and detrimental outcomes. For instance, increased automation may alleviate operators’ workload and enhance performance outcomes. Conversely, it may diminish the worker’s situational awareness and foster an excessive dependence on automated systems. Therefore, organisational 3D collaboration and simulation platforms impact human worker performance in conjunction with AI- driven automation. “Fusion Skills” reflect human and machine hybrid activities Graphic based on diagram from Daugherty and Wilson, Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AIHuman and machine hybrid activities Rehumanizing time Responsible normalizing Holistic melding Judgement integrationBot-based empowermentIntelligent interrogationHumans complement machines TRAIN AMPLIFY EXPLAIN INTERACT SUSTAIN EMBODYAI gives humans superpowers Reciprocal apprenticing Relentless reimagining Figure 19 Human and machine hybrid activities (Source: Daugherty & Wilson) World Manufacturing Report 2024 41As shown in Figure 20, the cross-study comparison shows the impact of AI on labour.

The IIoT, CPSs, and sensors generate and handle data flows which can be sensitive to the company itself or its customers. The shift towards interconnected processes and interoperable and hyper-connectivity systems increases the risks of cyberattacks that target critical infrastructures. Ransomware and data breaches from the IT level can halt production lines and reach the OT and ET levels, exposing proprietary information and compromising individual and customer data while causing revenue losses and delays in production, often leading to reputational damage. According to IBM119, the average data breach cost in 2024 is US$4.88m, with a 10% increase over last year and the highest total ever. The same study suggests that adopting AI for Cybersecurity can save US$2.8m. According to McKinsey, this will intensify as data leaders must adopt an “everything, everywhere, all at once” mindset to ensure that data across the enterprise can be appropriately shared and used. However, only 32% have robust measures to secure the data used. This gap leaves manufacturers vulnerable to cyberattacks and internal misuse or unintentional exposure of sensitive information. Emergence of cyber-physical systems The emergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS) signifies a tipping point in modern manufacturing, reshaping the industry by integrating the physical and digital worlds. CPSs combine real-time data exchange, advanced computing, and physical operations, enhancing decision-making and optimising production processes. Key technologies driving this transformation include digital twins and the industrial metaverse. These enable manufacturing companies to simulate, monitor, and optimise operations, dramatically reducing resource consumption and improving efficiency. Digital-twin technology, which creates virtual models of physical assets, has become increasingly common in manufacturing. Digital twins allow manufacturers to simulate and optimise processes, monitor performance in real time, and predict potential failures before they occur. This can significantly reduce development times, improve product quality, and lower costs by minimising errors and inefficiencies. For instance, a digital twin of a factory can model production workflows, identify bottlenecks, and suggest improvements, resulting in more streamlined operations. An elaborated and advanced example of the industrial metaverse in action is Nvidia’s Omniverse, which provides a real-time 3D collaboration and simulation platform. By using Omniverse, industries can create highly detailed digital replicas of their production environments, enabling teams to collaborate virtually on product design, optimisation, and troubleshooting. The platform’s ability to simulate entire factories and production lines helps companies accelerate time-to-market while reducing material and energy waste. Other companies, such as Siemens and Dassault Systèmes, offer similar platforms, providing integrated simulation, data analysis,", "char_len": 5629}

By feeding digital-twin-generated synthetic data into AI models, companies can train systems to recognise patterns and adjust in real time, improving operational efficiency. A study by Gartner120 suggests that by 2027, over 40% of large organisations worldwide will use a combination of Web3, spatial computing and digital twins in metaverse-based projects to increase revenue. The same study indicates that JPMorgan Chase, the US investment bank, is betting on the metaverse being a US$1 trillion per year opportunity as it becomes the first bank to open in Decentraland – one of the world’s most popular metaverse platforms. Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) tools have become essential for design, prototyping, and maintenance in manufacturing. AR/VR can enhance training, enable remote collaboration, and allow real-time visualisation of complex designs or production processes. People with different roles and work locations can use VR to attend a joint event virtually and locally. Maintenance workers can use AR to visualise repairs or upgrades, improving accuracy and reducing downtime. For example, it is possible to show digital equipment overlays, providing step-by-step guidance on complex repairs. At the same time, designers can collaborate across geographies using VR, enabling multiple teams to participate in virtual joint events and design reviews faster. The dark side of the “thirsty” AI-based digital twins. While the benefits of cyber-physical systems are significant, there are notable challenges. One of the primary downsides is the high computational power World Manufacturing Report 2024 43required for digital twins and simulations. Running these virtual environments requires substantial energy resources, particularly in data centres that support these complex models. Morgan Stanley estimates global data centre power use will triple this year, from ~15 TWh in 2023 to ~46 TWh in 2024121, while Wells Fargo projects a surge of 550% by 2026.122 If not managed sustainably, the environmental impact of supporting digital twins and other CPS technologies could offset some of the gains made in resource efficiency. Forbes details that the data centre was expected to require 1.3 million gallons of water daily from the county’s main water supply.123 Furthermore, there is a risk that overuse of the different digital tools will gradually limit human creativity and critical thinking in problem-solving. As systems become more automated and AI takes on more and more decision- making responsibilities, the role of designers, engineers, and operators could shift from active problem-solving to passive oversight, handing over the “humanising” factors. This could reduce opportunities for innovation, as human workers become less involved in creative and complex decision-making processes, or decision-makers will lose trust in the human designers unless there is AI-backed evidence of success for their suggestions. Lastly, the cost of implementing these technologies remains high. While large enterprises can afford to invest in digital twins, AI systems, and advanced computing infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may find it challenging to keep up with these technological advancements. This could lead to a widening digital divide, where only well-resourced companies benefit from CPS and digital twins. This could reduce competition and innovation within the industry, forming digital monopolies and virtual exclusion.

Such a panorama accentuates the need for legal support, such as regulatory actions that support companies.Ethical human-technology symbiosis The increasing symbiosis between humans and technology has highlighted the need to partner up for problem- solving. Creative tasks and promoting equitable digital empowerment and social cohesion are also needed. Rather than technology merely being a tool for efficiency, it becomes an integrated partner in the manufacturing process. Thanks to the groundbreaking impact of AI, technology will be able to handle not only repetitive or dangerous tasks. Still, it will support human workers with creative problem-solving, innovation, and oversight. Human-AI teaming will generate a shift in the roles of workers and technology, which must also be redefined in legal terms in light of the fast-changing AI environment. The increasing partnership between humans and technology raises challenges, including data privacy, accessibility, usability, equality and universality. Embedding human values into legal and regulatory structures can foster technological advancements that drive innovation, enhance human wellbeing, and promote a more equitable society. Human wellbeing is an essential economic measure to complement traditional measures of national output. Organisations are being judged not only on their return on their owners’ investment but also on broader issues, such as how well they fulfil their responsibility to society. Inspired by Japan’s Society 5.0, an increasingly human approach to manufacturing seeks to harmonise the strengths of humans and machines, aiming to enhance creativity, human wellbeing, problem- solving abilities, and overall factory productivity.124 World Manufacturing Report 2024 44The following overview focuses on critical global and regional regulatory frameworks that are likely to shape the future of manufacturing. Global regulatory frameworks The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (such as SDG8) set ambitious goals related to the need to guarantee decent work conditions, reduce inequalities, ensure good health and wellbeing, and move towards responsible production and consumption. There is a concerted effort to develop global standards on the international stage. At the organisational level, international standards like ISO 27500:2016 and ISO 26000:2010 represent a pivotal reference point for companies that wish to become more focused on human wellbeing by optimising performance, minimising risks, maximising wellbeing in their organisation, and enhancing their relationships with customers. In a factory environment, the ILO Convention 155 on Occupational Safety and Health and the ISO 45001 on Occupational Health and Safety provide guidance and recommended actions by governments and within enterprises to promote occupational safety and health to improve working conditions. At a technological level, standards are under development in several human-related fields. OECD and UNIDO foster responsible innovation as a trustworthy technology development guided by democratic values, responsive to social needs and accountable to society. Human- centred design guidelines, like the ISO 9241 series, ISO 27500:2016, ISO 20282 and ISO/IEC 25010:2011, provide recommendations and principles, including accessibility, usability, or ergonomics, for designing human-centred computer-based interactive systems. By embracing the principles outlined in the ISO Norms, organisations can create products and services that meet users’ needs and contribute to society’s greater good. In doing so, they can foster innovation, promot", "char_len": 5739}

For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates transparency in data collection, user consent, data security, and the right of individuals to access and control their personal data. This regulation is crucial for ensuring that data collected from technologies used in smart factories, such as AI systems, is handled responsibly and ethically. The European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (Directive 89/391 EEC), adopted in 1989, was a substantial milestone in improving workplace safety and health. In 2004 the European Commission issued a Communication (COM [2004] 62) on the practical implementation of the provisions of some of the directives, namely 89/391 EEC (framework directive), 89/654 EEC (workplaces), 89/655 EEC (work equipment), 89/656 EEC (personal protective equipment), 90/269 EEC (manual handling of loads) and 90/270 EEC (display screen equipment)]. More recently, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires companies to disclose what they see as the risks and opportunities arising from social issues and the impact of their activities on people. In particular, ethical considerations surrounding AI and algorithmic accountability are also gaining prominence. The EU has adopted a regulatory approach to ensure the responsible use of AI and to address the risks posed by AI to fundamental rights. In December 2023, the trialogue negotiations between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU led to an agreement on harmonised rules on AI in the form of the EU AI Act.125 Some months later, the new AI Convention126 was signed by EU members, the US and the UK. This convention will be the first legally binding international AI treaty, which promotes responsible innovation and mainly focuses on protecting the human rights of people affected by AI systems. It is separate from the EU AI Act. Many countries are reluctant to adopt strict AI regulations like the EU due to concerns that such laws might impede innovation. However, the need to ensure responsible AI has increased through the rapid development of advanced AI systems, such as generative AI. In October 2023, the Group of Seven (G7) leaders, chaired by Japan, agreed on the Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework. Due to the continuous rapid development of AI technologies, norms and regulatory environments on responsible AI are likely to continue evolving. These principles were developed by the OECD’s AI Principles and Japan’s Social Principles of Human-Centric AI, which were adopted in 2019. Businesses developing, providing and using AI systems must comply with the applicable norms while remaining attentive to upcoming regulatory developments. World Manufacturing Report 2024 45This tipping point marks a decisive moment where the widespread availability and accessibility of human- centric digital technologies either bridge or deepen societal divides within and beyond the manufacturing sector. Norms and regulations should consider age- based society fragmentation, the digital divide between high-income and low-income geographical regions, and differences between large companies and SMEs (or even microenterprises). This involves making technology affordable and accessible to everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status or education, and providing inclusive training and education to equip all individuals with the necessary skills to thrive in a digital and human-centric economy. Legislators are pushed to foster equitable digital empowerment that promotes job satisfaction, productivity, and social mobility by enabling diverse workers to participate in technological advancements to participate in technological advancements actively. However, if digital technologies are not democratised, there is a risk of creating a technological elite, deepening societal di", "char_len": 5681}

These changes are not merely incremental; they create tipping points that fundamentally reshape manufacturing companies’ operations. The following overview focuses on critical global and regional regulatory frameworks that are likely to shape the future of manufacturing significantly. Global agreements and frameworks Global environmental agreements and frameworks are set to shape the future of manufacturing. These agreements establish broad, legally binding commitments that influence national policies and regulatory environments worldwide. The three critical global agreements likely to create major legal tipping points for the manufacturing sector in the coming decade are the Paris Agreement, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, the UN Sustainable Development Goa, and its expected successor for 2030. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, remains the cornerstone of global climate policy. T o achieve the target of limiting global warming to well below 2°C, the Paris Agreement requires signatory countries to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline their specific plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.127 These NDCs are reviewed and updated every five years, with the following significant round of updates expected around 2025. Manufacturing companies worldwide must comply with increasingly rigorous emissions standards as nations work to meet their updated NDCs. This could involve tighter limits on allowable emissions, mandatory carbon compensation measures, or introducing enhanced carbon pricing mechanisms.128 These NDCs are reviewed and updated every five years, with the following significant round of updates expected around 2025. Manufacturing companies worldwide must comply with increasingly rigorous emissions standards as nations work to meet their updated NDCs. This could involve tighter limits on allowable emissions, mandatory carbon offsetting measures, or introducing enhanced carbon pricing mechanisms. Adopting more aggressive carbon pricing strategies, such as expanded carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, will impose additional financial burdens on carbon-intensive manufacturing processes, pushing companies towards adopting low- carbon technologies. The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity, is another critical international agreement impacting the manufacturing sector. This framework sets out targets to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, emphasising the need for sustainable production practices, pollution reduction, and the restoration of ecosystems.129 The framework’s emphasis on reducing the ecological impacts of industrial activities is particularly significant for the manufacturing sector. Industrial processes contribute to biodiversity loss through pollution, resource extraction, and habitat destruction. The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework aims to address these issues by pushing for stricter regulations on pollution control and sustainable resource management, pushing the adoption of circular economy practices. It will be particularly relevant for sectors involved in producing and managing hazardous substances, such as chemicals and heavy industry. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, have provided a comprehensive framework for global action on various issues, including environmental sustainability.

The Green Deal, aiming for climate neutrality by 2050, includes a set of policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote resource efficiency. Expanding and revising the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), the world’s largest carbon market, is central to the EU’s strategy.130 The ETS is being strengthened to cover more sectors, with tighter caps on allowable emissions and a progressive reduction of available carbon allowances. For the manufacturing sector, this means increased costs associated with carbon emissions, driving the need for cleaner technologies and more efficient production processes to stay within the regulatory limits. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), slated for full implementation by 2026, represents another significant regulatory innovation.131 The CBAM will impose a carbon price on imports of carbon-intensive goods, effectively levelling the playing field between EU producers and foreign manufacturers subject to stringent carbon regulations. This mechanism is expected to have wide-reaching implications for global supply chains, compelling manufacturers outside the EU to reduce their carbon footprints if they wish to maintain access to the European market. Additionally, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), effective in 2024, will drastically expand the scope and depth of sustainability reporting for companies operating in the EU.132 Under the CSRD, large companies must provide detailed disclosures on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance, including specific metrics on emissions, resource use, and ecological impacts. For manufacturing companies, this means integrating sustainability more deeply into their corporate strategies and operations, as the directive emphasises transparency and accountability in environmental practices. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 represents a significant shift in federal climate policy aimed at catalysing the transition to a clean energy economy. The IRA introduces extensive tax credits and subsidies that incentivise adopting renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency measures, and sustainable industrial practices. This legislation translates into substantial financial incentives for the manufacturing sector to reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency, particularly in energy-intensive industries. The IRA also encourages the development of new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). As these initiatives gain momentum, manufacturers will face growing regulatory pressures to align with the national strategy for climate mitigation, which includes achieving a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.133 These measures are expected to reshape the manufacturing landscape, driving innovation and requiring significant investment in sustainable technologies to remain competitive in the US market. China’s drive towards stringent environmental regulation is anchored in its 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), which strongly emphasises reducing carbon emissions, increasing renewable energy sources, and enhancing industrial energy efficiency.134 These include more aggressive targets for reducing coal use and expanding renewable energy capacity, necessitating technological upgrades and operational shifts within the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, China is expanding its regulatory framework to include stricter enforcement of existing environmental laws and introducing new regulations, such as the Solid Waste and Chemical Management Law, which places additional responsibilities on manufacturers regarding waste disposal and recycling. The 15th Five- Year Plan is likely to continue these trends, embedding environmental sustainability into the national industri", "char_len": 6034}

In general, compliance directives drive manufacturers to deeply integrate sustainability into their operations, requiring comprehensive ESG disclosures and adherence to evolving global sustainability standards. Global value chain disruptions The evolving landscape brought about by global manufacturing advances has illuminated the increasing need for legal frameworks that promote resilience within the manufacturing sector. Companies strive to strengthen their manufacturing capabilities to remain competitive, creating an urgency to encourage legal measures. Still, they are not limited to acts, regulatory actions, and standards that support these efforts. Global agreements and frameworks The pursuit of resilience within the global manufacturing sector has reached tipping points caused by several disruptions of supply chains, which often result in significant negative impacts on product lines. In the last decade, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Suez Canal blockage served as regrettable wake-up calls and exposed the risks of overreliance on a single source or region for critical components. Among some consequences, factories in crucial manufacturing hubs like China shut down, and companies faced severe disruptions. This has led to a strategic shift towards diversifying supply chains to reduce dependency on any one location and brought to light trends such as reshoring, nearshoring and similar strategies. Digitalised manufacturing environments require alignment with some identified legal objectives, among which can be found: • Building trust in data sharing: Legal frameworks must prioritise establishing trust among stakeholders involved in data exchange, ensuring secure and reliable data flows. • Enhancing data availability: Making data more accessible is crucial for informed decision-making and operational efficiency. • Eliminating technical barriers to data reuse: Interoperability must be legally enhanced to facilitate the seamless reuse and sharing of data across different systems and platforms. • Clarifying data rights: Providing legal certainty regarding data ownership and rights to prevent disputes and foster a cooperative environment. Overall, the legal landscape must address the pressing issues of trust and interoperability in data-sharing legislation. As data becomes a central element of legal regulation, alignment is needed over a shared top-level metadata framework encompassing both intellectual property rights (IPR) and data rights. Regional agreements and frameworks • Legal concerns in digital manufacturing – The global semiconductor crisis, which lasted for over three years and disrupted the automotive industry, highlighted the need for action. In response, the European Union enacted the European Chips Act to create a robust framework that ensures supply chain security and resilience and strengthens the semiconductor ecosystem in the EU.137 • Legal frameworks for digital resilience – Legal ontologies have emerged from a perspective of traceability and interoperability. For example, the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), effective from January 2023 to January 2025, exemplifies a legal response to enhance financial entities’ IT security.138 By ensuring that the financial sector can withstand severe operational disruptions, DORA highlights the broader implications of digital resilience for other industries and the economy. In conclusion, the last few years have driven manufacturers to re-evaluate how global value chains must be restructured to be more resilient in the face of disruptions caused by external factors to companies. This has illuminated the many legal actions presented in this section to increase resilience. World Manufacturing Report 2024 48significantly ", "char_len": 5691}

In particular, the energy use in industry accounts for nearly 24% of total yearly GHG emissions due to the contribution of energy-intensive industries such as the manufacturing of iron and steel products (7%), which are hard to decarbonise; the production of chemical and petrochemical products such as fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, refrigerants, and oil and gas extraction (3%); the manufacturing of food and tobacco products (1%), which take into account the energy-related emission for converting raw agricultural materials into their final products; the production of non-ferrous metals (1%) such as aluminium, copper, lead, and zinc; and the energy- related emissions from manufacturing activities in other industries such mining and quarrying, construction, wood, textiles, and automotive. The manufacturing sector also contributes to direct industrial process emissions, which account for 5% of total GHG yearly emissions. GHG can be produced as a by-product of manufacturing and chemical processes. Production processes such as clinker production for the cement industry produce CO2 as a by- product during the conversion of limestone to lime. CO2 can also be emitted during the production of ammonia. “Every corporation is under intense pressure to create ever-increasing shareholder value. Enhancing environmental and social performance are enormous business opportunities to do just that.” — Pfeiffer (2004) Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions refer to the release of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases into the Earth’s atmosphere that trap heat, creating a ‘greenhouse effect’ that warms the planet. While this natural process is essential for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet’s temperature at a level suitable for ecosystems to thrive, human activities since the Industrial Revolution have Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from human activities continue to increase Non-CO2emissionsGHG Emissions (GtCO2.eq/yr)60 45 30 15 0 1850 1900 1950 2000 2019CO2 from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) CO2 from fossil fuels and industry Global surface temperature has increased by 1.1°C by 2011-2020 compared to 1850-1900 1.52.0 -1.0-0.50.00.51.0 1850 1900 Key1950Observed 2000warmest multi-century period in more than 100,000 years1.0 0.2 °C°C 00.5 11.52020Figure 22 Global rise in GHG emissions and surface temperature from 1850 to 2020141Environmental tipping points World Manufacturing Report 2024 49Lastly, waste-related emissions can be generated from end-of-life products, especially if they are landfilled (2%). The manufacturing sector is directly and indirectly responsible for nearly one-third of global CO2 emissions. GHG emissions and global warming are significant drivers of climate change. Under the Paris Agreement144 signed in 2015, countries agreed to reduce GHG emissions to keep the long-term global average surface temperature increase well below 2°C against pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. After almost ten years, however, research is warning that, under nearly all IPCC scenarios, the rise of temperature above 1.5°C against pre-industrial level and due to global warming will occur by the early 2030s.145 This will cause long-term, potentially irreversible and self-perpetuating changes to planetary systems or human welfare, including hot temperature extremes, heavy precipitation, agricultural droughts, and ecosystem disruption. In particular, climate change is likely to lead to sea levels rising from collapsing ice sheets, carbon release from thawing permafrost, and disruption of ocean or atmospheric currents (see Figure 24).

These percentages would be higher, reaching values equal to 26%, 44%, and 49%, if the temperature rose by 3.2°C.147 Biodiversity is also highly linked to changes in forests (tropical, boreal and temperate forests). T ogether with global warming, deforestation may negatively affect forest resilience. T o report some examples of tropical forests, as an indication, the Amazon rainforest has registered a loss of more than 75% in resilience towards temperature increase and rainfall reduction since the early 2000s. Moreover, the Amazon rainforest has always acted as a carbon sink due to CO2 fertilisation. Still, based on simulated studies, a global warming increase of between 2°C and 6°C could provoke a nonlinear decrease in the properties of the Amazon rainforest. The temperature increase may cause water limitation, reducing plants’ moisture transpiration on very short timescales (hours to days). Similar fast effects on rainfall can be registered due to deforestation, as the loss of trees can rapidly reduce evapotranspiration.148 Another critical element regards the fire regimes, which are expected to increase next year if habits do not change. For example, in Canada and its boreal forests, the frequency of fires during the last century has increased, causing a decrease in coniferous forests. This phenomenon at large could cause a change in the forest microclimate; for instance, insects may expand into North American boreal forests, causing changes in ecosystem dynamics.149 Humans, with their habits, are substantially affecting the temperate forests. The dynamics of these types of forests are like those of tropical forests. Indeed, a reduction in forest coverage reduces atmospheric moisture supply, which provokes a decrease in the precipitation downwind and a parallel increase in heat, which may amplify drying and warming in the affected areas.150 In parallel, Savannas that humans have used for centuries for agriculture are currently treated by forest invasion caused by the change in rainfall regime, fire diffusion, and increased CO2 emissions.151Figure 24 Negative expected consequences of crossing the climate tipping point by 2030146 World Manufacturing Report 2024 51These tipping points show that systems are currently unstable, and their resilience is under attack due to external changes. Changing the forests and savannas would give out more CO2 emissions, causing higher global warming. Natural resources depletion Looking at the country overshoot days, the resource usage pace is not under control (see Figure 25).152 This is even more crucial when we deal with critical raw materials that are impossible to substitute, have a complex supply, and are significantly economically important for key European sectors. Figure 25 Country overshoot days 2024153 Considering their importance, the European Commission has set some targets for their extraction (10%), processing and refinement (40%), recycling (25%), and dependency on foreign countries (65%) by 2030. One of the indicators that has been introduced to monitor resource efficiency (connected to the SDG8) is the material footprint. It is a demand-based indicator independent of where the materials come from, showing the requirements in terms of material. Figure 26 shows the data related to the material footprint registered in 2020 concerning regions and income groups.154 According to the data collected, it is evident that waste management and resource recovery have a small footprint, while food, mobility and built environment are the most impactful, especially for high-income groups.

For instance, waste can be categorised by the type of material (plastic waste, food waste, etc.), by the source of waste origin (municipal solid waste, industrial waste, commercial waste, etc.), or by the product type (electrical and electronic waste, end-of-life vehicles, etc.). The manufacturing sector is often entangled in generating industrial and product-related waste that arises when manufactured products arrive at their end-of-life). Industrial waste includes scrap materials, defective products, and packaging waste. This waste can be considered hazardous when it contains toxic chemicals that require careful handling and disposal. Improper industrial waste management practices can lead to soil and water contamination, posing significant risks to public health and the environment.

A recent report from UNEP estimated that, in 2020, global municipal waste generation reached 2.1 billion tonnes per year worldwide (see Figure 27).156 Owing to economic and population growth, this figure is projected to increase to 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050 (+56%) if no urgent actions are taken. Delving deep into the electrical and electronics industry, the 2024 edition of the global e-waste monitor report showed that, in only 12 years, the amount of e-waste generated per year worldwide almost doubled from 34 to 62 billion kg in 2022 (see Figure 28).158 E-waste is mainly generated by discarded large household appliances such as fridges, washing machines, ovens and dishwashers; small appliances such as microwaves, kettles, and toasters; IT and telecommunication equipment; lamps; screens and monitors; and photovoltaic panels. This amount is projected to increase to 82 billion kg by 2030. Leading causes for this rapid increase are technological progress, increased consumption, limited repair options, short lifecycles and inadequate e-waste management infrastructure.

Static value chains and manufacturing supply chains must become highly dynamic and adaptable to disruptions, including high-speed rapid reorchestrations and low recovery time after unforeseen changes and disruptions. Drivers The geopolitical landscape is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. The number of challenges significantly and simultaneously affecting the world and the manufacturing sector is growing — the term polycrisis can adequately describe the current world situation. The World Economic Forum has recently used the term “polycrisis” to explain the current world and the collective experience that everything is happening and having a significant impact.160 A polycrisis denotes a situation where different crises interact, resulting in the overall effect exceeding the sum of each part to a great extent.161 In the Global Risk Report 2023, the World Economic Forum shows that the global risk landscape is highly interconnected. Thus, diverse risks and crises, such as climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, rising costs of living and energy, etc., are at significant risk of leading to an interconnected polycrisis.162 While nations and regions worldwide try to cope with these crises – sometimes in different ways and at different paces – the conditions and geopolitical landscape become highly uncertain for manufacturing companies. The current state of manufacturing is under the influence and pressure of several positive and negative drivers. First, the impacts of climate change are becoming more frequent and pronounced, creating related disasters and irreversible tipping points worldwide. Although climate change can directly affect geopolitics, these are rarely discussed or accounted for. Climate change impacts can lead to negative tipping points; for example, rising global temperatures have caused the melting of polar ice sheets, leading not only to natural disasters and financial crises but also impacting human societies at large – creating food and water insecurities, mass migrations, regional conflicts and the destabilisation of governments. Moreover, the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic drove many countries to rethink their manufacturing strategies and undermined the vulnerabilities and dependencies between economies. An uneven distribution of global resources can lead to increased protectionism and isolation, diminishing international trade and industrial growth. Multipolarity and the competition for influence and dominance are important current themes. Political instability in many regions, armed conflicts, sanctions, protectionist policies, and shifting policies and regulations across nations and regions are among the challenges and potential negative aspects for the manufacturing sector. On the flipside, increased international collaboration on sustainability goals, regulations to combat climate warming, and promoting responsible use and development of new technologies may positively impact manufacturing and create favourable conditions and opportunities. T echnological sovereignty is a crucial goal for nations seeking to maintain control over their technological development, reduce dependence on foreign sources, and increase economic independence. New technological advancements are utilised to be ahead of competitors. Recent technological breakthroughs have made it to market and disrupted existing business models. Examples are the widespread introduction of LLMs such as ChatGPT and the advancement of EUV lithography. Additionally, existing web technologies are continually changing traditional business models. These drivers have put pressure on the affected companies.

Some other geopolitical disruptions worth mentioning that have put pressure on manufacturing are the disputes between China/Japan and China/Myanmar over rare- earth materials and semiconductor trade policies imposed by the US on China and South Korea’s plans to compensate citizens for forced labour in Japan during World War II. All this has heightened tensions, placing additional pressure on the semiconductor industry. The strained diplomatic relations between the two nations, key global tech supply chain players, could disrupt critical partnerships and material sourcing. As the semiconductor industry relies heavily on smooth international cooperation, any escalation of historical disputes could impact production, trade agreements, and the overall stability of the sector. The free flow of Internet traffic and global service offerings were taken for granted in the past. China was among the first countries to introduce comprehensive digital sovereignty in the early 2000s, also known as the “Great Firewall of China. ” With some years in between, many other nations, such as Iran, the UAE, and Turkey, followed President Xi’s idea when he proclaimed in 2015: “We should respect the right of individual countries to choose their path of cyber-development independently” . The EU did not block Internet traffic similarly but introduced policies such as the GDPR, the EU Data Act and the Digital Markets Act, making it impossible to offer services without fully complying with local laws. State The current state of global manufacturing systems includes uncertainty in manufacturing capacity, logistics, and supply. For instance, the prolonged Russia-Ukraine war has led to disruptions in trade and interrupted supply chain operations. Weaker demand for EU products in Russia or central Europe has increased regional price competition and energy supply imports. In addition to industrial complexity, manufacturing companies must keep up with the fast pace of changing regulations, sanctions and standards, which also differ in various countries. For instance, the scope of decarbonisation regulations varies in the EU, US, and Asia, but they share a common focus on achieving net-zero goals. For example, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) differs from the UK’s. The latter’s scope includes the shipping and energy sectors and different allowance levels. The EU has also introduced an import tax on carbon, which other countries are following closely. The varying pace of individual countries’ decarbonisation efforts can delay reaching global climate- change targets. The current state of digital global business opportunities is as fragmented as ever before. For instance, there are 17 different data protection laws. In addition, multiple other regulations, such as geo-blocking and payment restrictions, prohibit the free offering of digital services globally. The current state of cyberattack threats for manufacturing companies is daunting. About 25% of cyberattacks target manufacturing companies, exploiting over 260,000 known vulnerabilities.164 Companies witnessing these ongoing attack attempts face this new standard and are constantly alert. Manufacturing companies are currently operating in a VUCA world, one which is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. T", "char_len": 5704}

The inherent dependencies within complex global supply chains make their management highly challenging. Coordinating across multiple regions, suppliers, and processes increases the risk of disruption, complicating efforts to maintain efficiency, resilience, and reliability. Lastly, decision-makers may not have sufficient information about market conditions and current industrial states. Without data-driven insights and given the presence of ambiguous information related to the geopolitical situation, manufacturing decision-making can be severely affected. Impacts Cyberattacks are already having a high and increasing impact on manufacturing companies. From 2018 to 2023, 478 confirmed ransomware attacks on manufacturing companies were documented. The ransom demands ranged from US$5,000 to US$50 million. Manufacturing downtime varied from several hours to 76 days; the overall cost of downtime was estimated at US$46.2 billion. Changed data policies impact IT system costs, migration efforts, and maintenance. Global IT systems had to be split into regional data sovereignty zones, and many cloud platform providers offered special sovereignty zones to comply with local regulations. World Manufacturing Report 2024 57The impacts of geopolitical tensions, shifting regional and national alliances, trade wars, sanctions, natural disasters, etc., are significant for manufacturing companies and industries. Impacts include lower security in the supply of components and materials, longer lead times on supply, price fluctuations, and unexpected demand fluctuations. Various disruptive events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and the blocking of the Suez Canal, also significantly changed demand and supply conditions for manufacturing worldwide. Such disruptions and unexpected events can cause impaired efficiency and competitiveness due to a lack of supply, increasing safety stocks, and reduced operations. While unstable, volatile and unpredictable demand and supply conditions are becoming the new normal for many manufacturing industries, unpreparedness to tackle these situations may lead to prolonged recovery time after disruptions and significantly impaired competitiveness. Responses Resilience is critical to respond to the drivers and pressures impacting the manufacturing sector. T o enhance resilience in the face of geopolitical disruptions, manufacturing companies need to respond and build the right capabilities on all levels. From increasing flexibility and adaptability of manufacturing systems and internal operations, they are expanding the ability to rapidly orchestrate value chains based on changes in demand and supply conditions to developing dynamic resilience capabilities across the entire organisation. Strategic-level responses: building dynamic resilience capabilities Resilience against geopolitical threats can be designed into manufacturing organisations by building dynamic capabilities in three time-dependent stages of resilience: anticipation (when risks occur and could potentially become disruptions), coping (when disruptions occur) and adaptation (when organisations learn from disruptions so that they are avoided in the future).165 Enhancing anticipation capabilities — such as situation awareness, visibility, and security — empowers manufacturing companies to sense and forecast potential geopolitical risks and corresponding disruptions proactively. These companies can better anticipate and address future challenges by sharing knowledge and information and improving transparency within their supply chains. T echnologies such as digital twins can improve the real- time monitoring of supply chain shocks, digital platforms can enable end-to-end supply chain visibility and information sharing, and machine learning can create possible future scenarios where data is collected in real time from manufacturing to distribution.166 Furthermore, investing in safety stocks or buffers (redundancy), for i", "char_len": 6117}

This is a learning phase where companies continuously learn from disruptions and create better mitigation solutions for the future. Knowledge management capabilities, for instance, can help manufacturing companies act on previously generated knowledge (change management) or conduct upskilling, reskilling, and multi-skilling of new employees to avoid quick turnovers and related migration issues. Despite the known unknowns related to geopolitical tensions and uncertainty, manufacturing companies should invest in contingency planning that involves manufacturing reconfiguration and comprehensive scenario planning, for instance, creating a wide range of possible futures involving geopolitical risks and opportunities. Knowledge of their market position, such as financial strength, market share, efficiency, and an inherent ability to absorb losses, will help them create autonomy for critical materials and goods. Supply chain-level responses: Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) is a concept that can transform the manufacturing sector by providing dynamic and on-demand manufacturing capability and capacity – thereby increasing both the resilience and robustness of the manufacturing value chains. MaaS can be described as a distributed production system where resources are offered as services, allowing manufacturers to access networked providers to implement their manufacturing processes.167 While the concept of MaaS has gained significant relevance and attention in recent years, the idea is not new. Although many examples of MaaS are in action for simpler processes, making the concept work for any manufacturing process and across a significantly distributed number of World Manufacturing Report 2024 58manufacturing companies is a far more challenging and complex task with unknown and far-reaching potential. MaaS is a new and transformative paradigm where manufacturers can overcome the challenges in traditionally static value chains and increase resilience. Such challenges include high risks and long recovery times when disruptions change demand-and-supply conditions. For instance, if the supply of specific critical components suddenly becomes unpredictable or impaired due to, for example, changing global trade agreements, interrupted logistics, the closing of factories, etc., the recovery capacity of a manufacturing company relies on the ability to either utilise an existing stock or find alternative new suppliers. Likewise, suppose changes in the volume and variety of product demand occur, for instance, because of new trade agreements, market expansions, or changing regulations. In that case, the ability of manufacturers to meet new demand and business opportunities relies heavily on the ability to rearrange existing manufacturing processes quickly, activate additional manufacturing capacity, and reorchestrate the entire value chain to meet new demand conditions. With static supply chains and traditional buyer and supplier relationships, the ability to respond quickly to such changes is largely impaired. T o increase resilience, manufacturing companies must make decisions much more frequently and speedily regarding footprint design, where and how to invest in manufacturing capacity, which suppliers to engage with and use, and which logistics setups to use. This means that strategic manufacturing decisions need to be made much faster, immediately operational, and considered more frequently, with a much shorter time horizon. With the basis of offering a large variety of manufacturing processes and capabilities as services, manufacturing companies can form relationships and orchestrate value chains on demand. On one side, the service provider (a manufacturer offering existing processes and manufacturing resources as services) will be able to increase capacity utilisation and broaden the pool of potential customers to engage with. On the other side, t", "char_len": 5795}

Servitising manufacturing processes, resources, and assets and offering these internally and externally will enable manufacturers to dynamically orchestrate and reorchestrate supply chains and value networks based on volatile and dynamic conditions, such as disruptions, new opportunities, and unexpected events. Thus, previous strategic and long-term decisions related to production network building, supplier collaboration, factory building, etc., will be made operational and can be done efficiently and quickly on a shorter-term basis. In this way, companies will be able to qualify and connect with new suppliers more quickly, diversify and enlarge the supplier base significantly, increase the use of manufacturing resources and capacity, improve the ability to meet new market opportunities, meet local content requirements, localise manufacturing activities, mitigate risks and reduce the time for recovering after a disruption to demand or supply. The foundation for making manufacturing as a service work is extensive. Mainly, there is a need for highly adaptable, reconfigurable, and flexible manufacturing systems and processes that can be offered as a services; software, platforms and technologies for connecting manufacturing companies and matching the manufacturing as a service providers and consumers; new models, simulations, digital twins, and planning technologies; and new ways of sharing and accessing data across companies including the willingness of companies to engage in larger networked systems with potential cross-company and country regulatory barriers. Operational-level responses: internal flexibility Internal manufacturing flexibility refers to the ability of an in-house manufacturing system to adapt to changes in the production environment, including variations in product types, production volumes, and market demands. This adaptability is essential for manufacturing companies to react to market changes and supply chain disruptions. Manufacturing flexibility can be grouped into the following sub-categories: • Machine flexibility – the ability of machines to perform a range of operations or produce different products with minimal downtime or reconfiguration. • Routing flexibility – the capacity to alter the sequence of operations or the product flow through the manufacturing process, allowing adjustments based on current production needs. • Volume flexibility – the ability to scale production up or down in response to changes in demand without incurring excessive costs. • Product flexibility – the ease with which a manufacturing system can introduce new products or modify existing ones to adapt to changes in consumer preferences or market trends. World Manufacturing Report 2024 59• Process flexibility – the capability to employ various production processes for manufacturing a product, optimising production efficiency. • Expansion flexibility – the potential to increase production capacity to meet rising demand without significant investment in new machinery or equipment. • Operational flexibility – the overall agility of the manufacturing system, including its capacity.168, 169, 170 Manufacturing flexibility is crucial for companies that face fluctuating demand. It enables them to stay competitive and responsive to market disruptions. This flexibility can be achieved by introducing reconfigurable manufacturing cells with exchangeable tools and fixtures, allowing various products to change quickly over time. In parallel or as separate sequential processes, these cells might have higher initial investments than conventional lines but offer higher flexibility. In the context of increased uncertainty, the trade-off between cells with a short ROI and more expensive cells with more excellent flexibility corridors must be considered. Therefore, the investment decision must consider the changed business conditions. By tackling these three interrelated actions, building dy", "char_len": 5921}

World Manufacturing Report 2024 60The global manufacturing sector faces several significant economic challenges, showing the need to reinforce its industries’ agility and resilience. Drivers Crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic brought an unprecedented shock to global manufacturing due to mobility restrictions and shutdowns of factories, resulting in international supply chain disruptions.171 Regarding the dependency on the complex structure of supply chains within and across countries, a disruption in one part of the supply network can influence the global production process. In addition, the COVID-19 situation complicated customer habits and caused demand peaks in some businesses, such as healthcare products and electronic devices.172, 173 This crisis awakened the manufacturing sector to keep its eyes open for exogenous events; for example, extreme climate- related events (flood) and geopolitical developments (Russia-Ukraine conflict) could influence the functioning of supply chains and cause disruptions along regional and global supply chains. Geopolitical uncertainty. Rising tensions relating to wars in Europe and the Middle East and escalating US-China competition have created significant manufacturing risks, especially for businesses operating internationally. In addition, over 60 countries will hold national elections, involving nearly half of the world’s population voting in 2024, which could lead to a shift in leadership and policy. Business leaders cannot ignore political uncertainty against an evolving global order.174 One of the most significant issues manufacturing confronts is “How can global manufacturing remain in geopolitical uncertainty?” The cost of moving in the wrong direction is a risk to assets, growth, value creation, and people. On the contrary, there is a real advantage in building a systematic approach called geopolitical resilience. Digital Revolution. Manufacturing is encountering scalability, mass customisation, and interoperability challenges, and new technologies continue to emerge.175 Incorporating IoT, robotics, and analytics can enable organisations to react quickly, improving company performance and customer satisfaction. The digitally connected ecosystem and real-time visibility assist in the removal of silos across the sectors while adding information transparency in supply chains, responding to customer needs quickly, and cooperating with partners to strengthen trust.176 Even though integrating technology into manufacturing provides opportunities for manufacturers to design innovative products and bring them to market faster, it has been controversial because of its detrimental effects on job displacement and energy conservation. Therefore, the issue", "char_len": 5840}

For example, jobseekers may find work more efficiently and may get higher wages. Yet upward wage pressures spur inflation and stress businesses, as companies may need to turn down orders because they cannot hire enough workers to satisfy demand. Without action, labour shortages may continue to hit sectors that struggle to increase productivity. Manufacturing must consider productivity and find new ways to expand the workforce by focusing on skilling and reskilling, offering more flexible work, and internal mobility. Innovation With global dynamics in flux, companies have faced significant changes, ranging from evolving customer requirements to demand fluctuations and complex planning systems. Innovation helps manufacturers pursue growth opportunities and effectively compete in the ever- evolving market while navigating volatility and uncertainty. Economic actions World Manufacturing Report 2024 61Developing new products and services enables manufacturers to meet the changing needs of customers and markets while streamlining production processes and reducing costs. Thus, modern manufacturers are pressured to hasten their product/process innovation through digital transformations and Industry 4.0 technologies focusing on agility, resilience, and customer- centricity. State Outdated manufacturing business and operational models and deficiency in innovation in SMEs Due to rapid technological advancements, traditional business and operating models must be updated. According to the European Commission, enterprises with fewer than 250 employees and an annual turnover of less than €50 million are classified as Small and Medium- sized Enterprises (SMEs). Due to limited financial resources and a knowledge gap regarding the benefits of new technologies, SMEs’ investments in innovation are constrained. As a result, SMEs often struggle with outdated business practices and operational strategies, which can impede their ability to adapt to changing market conditions. The ongoing increase in energy consumption in the manufacturing sector According to the US Energy Information Administration, the industrial sector consumes more delivered energy than any other end-use sector, accounting for approximately 54% of the world’s total delivered energy. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization estimates that industrial energy use will grow between 1.8% and 3.1% annually over the next 25 years. This increasing state of energy consumption highlights the need to shift towards only renewable energy, which presents challenges and opportunities. Green energy investments can offer competitive advantages and help stabilise the volatility of energy costs. The current state of the global manufacturing sector after all these pressures The manufacturing sector continues to face significant challenges. 2024 manufacturers are expected to grapple with economic uncertainty, ongoing skilled labour shortages, persistent supply chain disruptions, and new pressures to innovate products to meet net-zero emissions targets. T echnology is set to play a crucial role in helping manufacturers navigate these hurdles. Despite the challenging business environment and some companies considering pausing investments, many manufacturers remain focused on digital transformation, prioritising efficiency and organisational resilience. They are increasingly adopting smart factory approaches, exploring the industrial metaverse, and leveraging new technologies like generative AI ", "char_len": 5808}

The scarcity of raw materials is the most frequent cause of disruptions in the manufacturing supply chain, substantially impacting production rates, increasing costs, and diminishing customer satisfaction. Increased labour costs Rising inflation has led to a higher cost of living, causing workers to demand increased wages to sustain their standard of living. This poses a significant challenge for manufacturers under growing pressure to raise wages. If manufacturers do not meet these demands, they face the risk of labour unrest and potential work stoppages, which could halt the production of goods and services. Despite the additional financial burden, many manufacturing companies have been forced to raise employee wages to prevent such disruptions. This adjustment aims to maintain production continuity and satisfy market demand, highlighting the impact of increased labour costs driven by inflation. Product innovation and process innovation Innovation pressure in the global manufacturing sector has led to significant positive impacts, with product and process innovation standing out as key drivers of competitive advantage. Product innovation involves developing new products from novel materials or enhancing existing products to better satisfy customer needs. This type of innovation can open new markets or better serve existing ones, making it a crucial source of competitive edge for firms. By improving product quality, product innovation boosts overall firm performance and strengthens market positioning. Process innovation, in contrast, focuses on reengineering and enhancing internal business operations. It spans World Manufacturing Report 2024 62various functions, including technical design, R&D, manufacturing, management, and commercial activities. Process innovation involves developing new or improved techniques, systems, and procedures to transform inputs into outputs through technological advancements, skill development, and operational improvements. For the manufacturing sector, process innovation is critical and should be emphasised as a core competency for gaining a competitive advantage. It is closely linked to firm growth and is essential for sustainable success. Responses Business Continuity Management Business Continuity Management (BCM) is a comprehensive management process designed to identify potential organisational threats and assess their impact on business operations. It establishes a framework for building organisational resilience. It provides the capability for an effective response that protects the interests of key stakeholders and the organisation’s reputation, brand, and value-creating activities. BCM integrates various disciplines, including Emergency Response, Crisis Management, Disaster Recovery (technology continuity), and Business Continuity (organisational and operational relocation). According to the Business Continuity Institute (BCI), BCM’s primary goal is to safeguard the organisation against potential disruptions by ensuring it can effectively respond to and recover from events, minimising the impact on customers, clients, and overall operations. Digital-twins technology Manufacturers worldwide face significant pressure to meet demand in an environment marked by resource constraints, talent shortages, and ongoing supply chain disruptions. In response to these challenges, digital twins are gaining prominence as a leading technology, enabling manufacturers to quickly scale capacity, enhance resilience, and optimise operational efficiency. A digital twin is a virtual replica of a system’s behaviour within its operating environment, from a single product to a complex manufacturing process or an entire supply chain. This replica consists of a collection of digital models that simulate the system by processing and responding to data from its external environment. By integrating various models and data sources, digital twins offer a more accurate representation of real-world objects than tr", "char_len": 5938}

In manufacturing, digital twins are primarily used through virtual simulation models to create precise, solid models applied to product processing and assembly, ensuring accurate and efficient production control. Effective knowledge transfer Effective knowledge transfer is essential to tackle labour shortages. This can be achieved through structured mentoring programmes, where experienced employees share their expertise with newcomers. Complementing this with tutorials or digitised training manuals makes information more accessible. Implementing knowledge management frameworks that track the knowledge lifecycle, from creation to sharing and valorisation, is particularly crucial in the manufacturing sector, where managing operational knowledge effectively is vital. These approaches help preserve the company’s skills and expertise. According to the knowledge-based view, knowledge significantly impacts a firm’s competitiveness. The transfer of best practices involves replicating superior internal processes across the organisation, which are proven to outperform other internal and external practices. This process encompasses the routine use of knowledge, the tacit knowledge of individuals, and collaborative arrangements within the organisation. Best-practice transfer occurs when both a need and the knowledge to address that need exist within the organisation. Knowledge transfer also plays a vital role in driving innovation, which provides firms with a competitive edge and enables them to survive, grow, and thrive. Agile product development Agile manufacturing has emerged as a leading approach to maximise and increase the positive impacts of product and process innovation. Agile is a work methodology that leverages change as a competitive advantage rather than viewing it as a drawback. It achieves this through rapid learning, quick decision-making cycles, and utilising networks of teams within a people-centred culture. Agile is not limited to software development; it applies to hardware product development and complex systems World Manufacturing Report 2024 63that integrate hardware and embedded software, such as autopilot and infotainment systems in the aerospace, automotive, and consumer electronics industries. Agile Transformation in the manufacturing sector requires a significant mindset shift, making the process comprehensive and iterative. It is comprehensive because it impacts nearly all aspects of the business and iterative because it demands constant adaptability in working methods. Agile for hardware product development maintains the core principles of agile software (flexibility, evolution, and iteration) but must be specifically tailored to accommodate the unique nature of hardware products and the business environment. T o successfully implement agile, leaders and managers should focus on five key areas: strategy, structure, process, people, and technology. The strategic implementation of these responses shields companies from immediate disruptions and provides long-term economic benefits. These include reduced costs, enhanced operational efficiency, and sustained competitive advantages, all of which contribute to more robust financial performance and resilience in an increasingly volatile business environment. Drivers Crises like COVID-19, geopolitical tensions and the digital revolution drive changes in manufacturing by disrupting supply chains, increasing uncertainty, and demanding rapid adaptation to new technologies and market conditions.

World Manufacturing Report 2024 64As the manufacturing sector undergoes significant shifts, the social dimension of these changes plays a crucial role in shaping the future of its workforce. Drivers We have identified three major societal drivers that will reshape global manufacturing. The first is the growth of prosperity and its impact on social demographics, driven by the overall economic development of nations. The second driver is regulatory shifts to improve working conditions, a key policy issue in many countries. Lastly, consumer behaviour is critical, driven by evolving market conditions and increasing demand for ethical practices.Prosperity growth and its impact on social demographics Pursuing global prosperity is a key factor shaping the social context of manufacturing. As countries achieve higher levels of prosperity, interest in manufacturing declines. At the same time, service-related industries expand, as illustrated by the smiling curve in Figure 29.183 This shift significantly changes workforce demographics. Workers become more urbanised and seek jobs less associated with manual labour. Additionally, as prosperity grows, fertility rates tend to decline, creating challenges for workforce renewal. Younger generations are less attracted to traditional manufacturing roles, driving a significant transformation in the sector. Moreover, rising prosperity is associated with increased environmental and social sustainability awareness, shifting consumer behaviour towards greener products and companies committed to environmental issues and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Social actions Figure 29 Smile curve by nation using the World Input-Output Database, 1995–2011 (Source: Baldwin & Ito, 2022) Brazil World Manufacturing Report 2024 65However, prosperity growth is only uniform across some countries. Many nations have been left behind. As evidenced by World Bank data (see Figure 30)184, shared prosperity shows significant disparities across regions, with many low-income countries lacking available data. This indicates that social challenges for workers remain a substantial obstacle in achieving sustainable manufacturing for the future in these regions. Figure 30 Shared prosperity worldwide (Source: World Bank, 2024) Shared Prosperity - Growth rate of the Bottom 40 (Annualized growth rate, %)Annualized growth rate, % 8.3 -5.0 Regulatory shifts for improved workforce conditions Governments and international organisations increasingly impose stricter regulations on environmental sustainability and labour practices, particularly in combatting modern slavery and improving workforce conditions. This is driven by the need to address the still alarmingly high number of workers subjected to modern slavery worldwide, as reported by the International Labour Organization (see Figure 31).185 For instance, laws such as the UK Modern Slavery Act and the EU’s proposed mandatory due diligence legislation require companies to ensure that their supply chains are free from forced labour, human trafficking, and other exploitative practices. The European Union’s Green Deal, while primarily focused on environmental objectives, also underscores the importance of responsible labour practices as part of sustainable operations. Compliance with these regulations is essential for manufacturers to avoid legal repercussions and meet rising consumer demands for ethical labour standards and transparency throughout the supply chain. World Manufacturing Report 2024 66Changing consumer expectations Consumers today are increasingly concerned with the ethical and sustainable practices of the brands, products, and services they support. This rising demand for corporate responsibility extends beyond environmental issues, including how manufacturers treat their workers, focusing on fair labour practices and safe working conditions. As a result, manufacturers must align their operations with these consumer values to strengthen brand", "char_len": 5754}

Research on Generation Z indicates that more than half of respondents are not interested in frontline manufacturing roles, with around 30% perceiving such work as “low-skilled, manual labour, ” which does not align with their career aspirations.189 As a result, the manufacturing sector faces pressures to attract and retain new workers, leading to higher turnover rates. The declining interest among younger people in manufacturing creates a generational challenge that impacts the industry’s labour-intensive activities and the accumulation of workforce experience. New regulations, particularly those concerning workforce conditions, put pressure on companies to increase transparency about how their workers are treated and how they carry out their activities. While this drives positive change by improving worker wellbeing and ensuring that suppliers are equally committed to ethical practices, it also creates challenges, particularly for accessing suppliers and low-cost manufacturing options. Not all suppliers can meet the required levels of transparency and legal compliance. As a result, manufacturers are under pressure to develop their supply chains further or redefine them to ensure that good working conditions are upheld. On the other hand, evolving consumer behaviour and social values regarding sustainability are creating positive pressure on global manufacturing. The growing demand for manufacturers to comply with ESG standards — measuring environmental, social, and governance impact — drives greater transparency and compels companies to adopt more sustainable practices.190 With these new standards, manufacturing companies have higher pressure on their market operations. The responsibility over products and how manufacturers develop new products to meet sustainable requirements are also important, resulting in pressure from this new ESG context. This is a market expectation and economic pressure since the global ESG investing market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18.8% from 2024 to 2030,191 as shown in Figure 32.AI-BASED BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS37,3m 12,3mAdults Children22,8m 26,7mMale Female49,6mWorld 6,6m7,2m 12,7m 23,7m Low incomeLower-middle incomeUpper-middle incomeHigh income Number of people (millions) in modern slavery, by sex, age, region and income grouping, 2021Prevalence (per thousand population) of modern slavery, by sex, age, region and income grouping, 20215,2‰ 5,0‰ 10,1‰ 6,8‰ 6,9‰Europe and Central AsiaAsia and the PacificArab StatesAmericasAfrica 5,9‰ 4,4‰ 7,8‰ 9,6‰Low incomeLower-middle incomeUpper-middle incomeHigh income7,0m 5,1m 1,7m 29,3m 6,4mEurope and Central AsiaAsia and the PacificArab StatesAmericasAfrica6,9‰ 5,2‰Adults Children6,9‰5,8‰Male Female6,4‰World Figure 31 People in modern slavery worldwide (Source: ILO, 2022) World Manufacturing Report 2024 67State The described pressures modify the state and condition of the global manufacturing ecosystem.

Over the past few decades, automation has advanced significantly within the industry, leading to widespread job losses globally (see Figure 33).

Workers, in contrast, have proven to be highly resilient and adaptable, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, when companies had to adjust their manufacturing systems rapidly. While automation can reach a point where the recovery of jobs in manufacturing becomes irreversible, potentially diminishing companies’ capacity to pivot quickly, a resilient and adaptive workforce remains a crucial factor for the sustainability of the sector. Impacts The drivers, pressures, and conditions affect the manufacturing sector in three primary outcomes: manufacturing productivity, adaptability and innovation, and employee commitment and wellbeing. Manufacturing productivity The loss of knowledge due to the lack of workforce renewal and resulting skills gaps affects manufacturing productivity. In both developed and developing countries, the workforce is ageing rapidly, ending the era of abundant labour that fuelled economic growth in past decades.195 While more people are working into their 60s and beyond, this is unlikely to offset the negative impact of an ageing population, as productivity declines with advancing age. Additionally, younger generations are less interested in manufacturing careers, leading to higher turnover rates among new workers. This high turnover among younger workers prevents them from advancing beyond the early stages of their learning curves, further exacerbating the challenge of achieving higher productivity levels. Adaptability and innovation A homogenous and less competitive workforce negatively impacts adaptability to changing contexts and stifles innovation capacity. A Deloitte study shows that increased diversity introduces new knowledge and perspectives, both crucial for driving innovation and problem-solving.196 The loss of opportunities due to a lack of diversity has been highlighted in recent research, which demonstrates how much companies stand to gain by prioritising diversity. For example, a survey conducted by BCG of 1,700 companies across various countries — including Austria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, and the US — revealed that organisations with above-average diversity in their leadership teams experience greater returns from innovation and higher EBIT margins (see Figure 34).197 Additionally, a diverse workforce enhances a company’s ability to understand consumer behaviour and social values, enabling it to deliver products that are better aligned with market expectations. Employee engagement and wellbeing Lastly, companies focusing on new business structures that are concerned with social issues can positively impact employee commitment and wellbeing. For instance, the 2022 Gallup report showed that employees who feel included are more engaged. Furthermore, new working models featuring more flexible time schedules, a greater emphasis on workers’ personal needs, and remote work options are emerging as critical demands. ", "char_len": 5740}

Moreover, these systems should focus on the wellbeing of every individual. This includes stress prevention, mitigating the risk of diseases, flexible work arrangements, and creating work cultures promoting work-life balance. Workers should be part of the decision- making process for technology implementation and be Figure 34 Companies and diversity (Source: BCG, 2018) allowed to bring their values, needs, and ideas into the technology design and deployment. Second, industrial leaders should emphasise workforce education and commit to their employees’ learning and personal development. T o achieve that, employers must invest in the support systems needed to understand and measure skills gaps and give their employees the resources to upskill themselves. In addition, employees need to develop a growth mindset and lifelong learning, while this requires leaders to create a culture of curiosity and openness. More than half of global CEOs are scared that skills shortages will significantly impact profitability in their industry over the next ten years.199 However, manufacturing leaders will have to balance internal training with external hiring despite the difficulties due to the demographic trends. Therefore, when hiring and developing talent, managers should focus on the skills of their workforce, rather than only on diplomas. Thus, the manufacturing sector opens up to more potential candidates and can work more practically to develop the skills of their workforce. Lastly, manufacturers have both a business and a moral imperative to go beyond and advance DEI initiatives. For this purpose, many responses can be implemented. Here, we have highlighted six critical actions to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in a manufacturing sector: (i) Expand Diversity Definitions – include diverse cognitive styles and physical needs to foster a more inclusive environment; (ii) Create an inclusive culture – create a supportive culture where employees can be their authentic selves, encouraging open dialogue and diverse perspectives; (iii) Address equity across the workforce – ensure equity in all areas, including career development, compensation, and promotions; (iv) Develop inclusive leadership – build leaders who embody essential traits such as commitment, courage, bias awareness, curiosity, cultural intelligence, and collaboration; (v) Facilitate behavioural change and enhance accountability – implement actions to drive behavioural change, ensuring transparency of DEI efforts and results and, (vi) Walk the talk – demonstrate genuine commitment to DEI by aligning actions with stated values and ensuring that DEI principles are integrated into every aspect of the organisation. Implementing human-centric practices, worker education, and DEI initiatives is critical for overcoming manufacturing companies’ social challenges. These approaches can enhance manufacturing productivity, promote adaptability and innovation, and improve employee engagement and wellbeing.

Additionally, limited access to resources and raw materials, soaring energy prices and regulations for reduced energy usage have put the industry under more pressure. As a result, manufacturers are forced to innovate to produce more qualitative and greener products with fewer resources and less dependence on raw materials. This has led manufacturers to push for flexibility and modular production while aiming to make more products with fewer personnel and using fewer resources. Because of this, manufacturers are now pushing for modular production and flexibility to produce more goods with fewer workers and resources. The old economies of scale are ineffective under this new regime, and to satisfy the wide range of market demands, a shift towards economies of scope is needed. One of the main forces behind the industry’s investigation and implementation of new technologies is the need for efficiency and flexibility. Another driver is the race for early adoption of emerging technologies to obtain a competitive advantage. Early adopters of Industry 4.0 technologies such as CPS, Industrial Metaverse and digital twins, Artificial intelligence (AI), Gen AI, and AR/VR will present better quality, higher customer satisfaction, faster ramp-up times and time- to-volume, gaining market leadership in their respective industries. Higher ESG ratings lead to better investments, and becoming a pioneer of Industry 4.0 contributes to the company’s branding and is considered a leader in sustainability and forward thinking. However, inherent risks are also connected to the race, such as technological obsolescence due to rapid technology cycles, mismatches between investments and market demands, and slow skill growth with constant workforce training. Since 2022, there has been a booming development of Gen AI, which presents significant opportunities for innovations in manufacturing as well. The previous applications of the complex generative design can be even further improved with LLMs by using natural language and becoming human- centric. Optimisation and explicability of production and planning and scheduling orders are expected to be the next step after vertical integration of all layers, shop floor, enterprise, and facility. Generative AI will, therefore, support the economies of scope and facilitate mass customisation. Its integration into IT systems will enhance predictions of customer expectations and desires, while its application on the shop floor will enable predictive maintenance and predictive operation capabilities. GenAI radically changes how manufacturers approach innovation and problem-solving by simulating outcomes, generating models, and offering sophisticated decision-making tools. The difficulty, though, is appropriately integrating GenAI into current interoperable and secure systems. Pressures T o remain competitive in such a variable and fast-moving landscape, manufacturing has to be up to date, with high- quality, green(er) products and sustainable practices. The rapid pace and advancement of technologies, such as AI, IIoT, and automation, put pressure on the manufacturers that if they do not act, they will fall behind, which is fundamental to a certain degree. Still, without a roadmap and a plan, reacting alone to the feeling of keeping up is riskier than investing time to assess readiness levels. The sense of losing ground and market share is intensified when competitors are quicker to adopt such innovations, which often leads to significant investments in the latest technology. Rushing into new technologies with clear long- term plans, a defined roadmap, and clear prioritisation areas usually results in costly mistakes, and some systems can quickly become obsolete or disjointed if the integration is", "char_len": 5530}

T o develop fast results and instantly reap the benefits of innovations, manufacturing companies must consider more aspects of their enterprises and not focus solely on technology. For example, the personnel’s skill level, the learning and development structures, the company’s understanding of new technologies, its culture and strategy, and the Technological actions World Manufacturing Report 2024 71collaboration levels among its departments must be modernised and aligned to achieve revenue maximisation. With the rise of Gen AI, misinformation is spreading and becoming an increasing concern in manufacturing. Although GenAI provides solid data analysis, design, and production optimisation capabilities, it may produce false or misleading results if it is not taught or used correctly. Erroneous AI-generated predictive models, for example, can overstate specific trends or present inaccurate data, forcing firms to make expensive decisions based on incorrect information if they trust its results entirely. As the volume of AI-generated content and data increases, the risk of misinformation is even higher. Decision-makers are facing the challenge of distinguishing valuable insights from noise and validated from invalidated data. More reliance on such systems will add further pressure on companies to establish more accurate and more efficient verification processes, requiring the respective expertise and experience of the personnel involved. Therefore, manufacturers should invest in training and educational programmes, purchase validated systems with responsible data and AI, and educate their teams to critically evaluate AI-generated information to avoid errors and inefficiencies. State The ecosystem’s boundaries will change due to the potentially rising competition, changing lifecycles of solution development, and the increasing risk of misinformation. Applying advanced technologies can bring new stakeholders into the ecosystem and reshape the existing ecosystem. Some stakeholders in the current ecosystem could also be unnecessary in the future and, therefore, excluded from the newly established ecosystem. Newly developed technologies can foster new solutions that may substitute existing ones. Applying more advanced technologies, such as AI, IIoT, and digital twins, will trigger the shift of human roles, necessitating upskilling and the reskilling of existing personnel. With technological advancement, we are observing that new markets are emerging, and the use of technology demands that the synchronisation of the markets and networking change accordingly. The type of innovation is crucial to the extent to which networking will change. For incremental innovation, the changes are not as significant as for radical innovation. However, there is this stagnant dilemma that all innovation is becoming incremental at the larger scale; nevertheless, systematic changes made at the firm level could still be radical for that particular firm. The potentially rising competition, changing lifecycles of solution development, and the increasing risk of misinformation can also make the sustainable ecosystem imbalanced. The anticipated colossal power consumption will challenge the current energy generation and supply. The growing demand for semiconductors and batteries can damage the mining of critical components that compromise sustainability’s social and environmental perspectives to chase more profit. There are many driving forces that can disrupt the balance of the ecosystem. The rise in GHG emissions and governance issues of the different economies causes imbalances in the ecosystem. Thus, to balance the ecosystems, policy changes are being made on the global level to ensure the reduction in carbon footprint and reusable energies.

The consensus is that any technical innovation should be developed and used to strengthen the resilience of the overall or part of the production system in one way or another. For example, with AI-powered systems applied, the manufacturing sector can better optimise the production and maintenance schedules and predict the future occurrence of disturbances. VR can enable the manufacturing sector to have meetings online or upskill and reskill employees without prototypes or physical facilities. AI-powered digital twins can make better decisions regarding real-time production scenarios without human interference. Intelligent robots can work better for and with humans, enhancing production by creating a safer and more ergonomic working environment and improving efficiency and quality. Although applying advanced technologies to the manufacturing sector has massive potential benefits, there are also some challenges. The enormous application of digital technologies will impose immense pressure on power and hardware. The gigantic computing servers supporting widely applied AI applications are anticipated to require considerable semiconductor investment and World Manufacturing Report 2024 72consume enormous amounts of electricity. The ever- growing interconnected manufacturing system will pose significant challenges to guaranteeing cybersecurity. The socio-technological shift towards sustainable, resilient, and human-centric development has driven the change in customers’ mindsets and preferences in choosing the products they purchase. Customers increasingly consider the ethical perspective when selecting products. These conscious customers invest in brands that demonstrate genuine ethical commitments instead of buying products. With more and more devices connected to the internet and the persistent advances in communication technologies, customers have become increasingly well-informed and better able to retrieve information from diverse pathways. Customers can retrieve more information about the overall value chains with more and more technologies. Therefore, the manufacturing sector should be more committed and transparent in integrating integrity into their business. This integration is not only beneficial but essential as well. Integrating integrity will strengthen the organisation’s reputation and customer loyalty, fostering a more robust business to achieve tremendous success. On the contrary, failure to do so can undermine customer trust and brand reputation, further damaging the overall business or even leading to its eventual elimination. Responses Whenever a firm proposes a vision or strategy change, the managers must make many changes to become technology ready. The firm’s strategy must be adjusted to accommodate the absorption and adaptation challenges. Furthermore, organisations need to consider their technology strategy more cautiously than ever. Competition between competitors, the fear of being obsolete, and the emergence of new business models can revolutionise the industry radically. The industry must consider changing its attitude towards technological innovations and its philosophy of integrating innovative technologies into its business. Companies should also consider the changes in their business models to react to the changing ecosystem. The business model also has significant design changes because of the technology shift. The previous WMF Report (2023) went into detail on business model changes (servitised business models) and how each component of the business model changes when enabled through technology such as artificial intelligence (AI). This causes manufacturers to change their supply chain and value networks dynamically. The company’s managers bring about one significant response to technological changes.

Legal actions Without timely legal adaptations, the manufacturing sector could find gaps in safety, privacy, and social equity that could hinder the broader societal progress envisioned by this revolution. Drivers Several factors drive the legal aspects of the manufacturing sector. In light of new global priorities, which have reinforced the need to explore the role of humans in manufacturing alongside the pressing environmental situation and the need for more resilient systems, some identified drivers are given below. One of the main drivers impacting legal actions in the manufacturing sector is the rapid development of digital technologies that are part of the digital transformation of manufacturing companies. For instance, AI, a technology that has quickly revolutionised companies’ activities, has brought along many questions as companies see it as a significant opportunity to enhance efficiency, precision, and innovation, driving engagement from a legal perspective. Moreover, trust in AI-human interaction, especially in decision-making, varies among individuals, making designing fair, transparent, and secure systems crucial. This topic can also benefit from robust legal frameworks; companies can build sustainable human-AI collaborations that support a more inclusive and trustworthy integration of AI in the workplace. Another driver for legal actions in the manufacturing sector is the need for a skilled workforce. In this sense, legal frameworks must evolve to address the potential marginalisation of specific jobs and skills, ensuring that World Manufacturing Report 2024 74workers’ rights are protected in an increasingly AI- driven world. This includes updating workplace safety and risk management norms to account for integrating enabling technologies and AI, thereby safeguarding worker protection and reducing employer liability. Legal frameworks could evolve to mandate the ", "char_len": 5714}

Despite being a work in progress, designing technologies with human values at their core necessitates rapidly developing a comprehensive legal approach. This includes incorporating ethical principles, privacy protection, inclusivity, societal impact, and accountability into developing and deploying technologies. As human-AI teaming becomes more prevalent, ambiguity in liability and responsibility must be addressed to prevent legal disputes over errors or failures. Legal ambiguity may arise over who is responsible – the human operator, the AI system, or the developer – leading to potential conflicts and legal disputes. Another pressure faced in the manufacturing sector is the inefficient use of resources, generating waste and emissions. In this sense, the pressure to reduce carbon footprints drives companies to integrate comprehensive carbon management practices into their operational and innovation frameworks. Moreover, with the introduction of stringent biodiversity and ecosystem restoration regulations, manufacturing companies need to respond strategically and operationally to meet legal requirements while managing risks. This area also adds pressure to collaborate, as manufacturers must focus on internal changes and engage in industry-wide collaborations and policy advocacy. By participating in forums that shape carbon regulation policies, firms can influence the development of feasible and practical regulatory frameworks. Collaborations, such as those through industry consortia or partnerships with environmental organisations, enable shared solutions for carbon reduction, such as joint investments in renewable projects or shared carbon capture facilities. From a regulatory perspective, not managing biodiversity strategically will become a significant risk for manufacturing companies in the future. Manufacturers should integrate biodiversity risk management into their corporate strategies. Through comprehensive biodiversity impact assessments, firms can anticipate potential regulatory impacts and adapt their practices accordingly. The rapid technological development of connectivity and data use puts pressure on the manufacturing sector, increasing the risk of cyberthreats and other data- related concerns. This pressure stems from the fact that long-established companies in the manufacturing sector embrace digitalisation to the extent that, in some instances, they also open themselves up to a new breed of vulnerabilities. In this sense, the need for regulatory frameworks, regulations, and standards becomes ever more relevant to regulating how cyber protection can support the protection of individual companies and complete value chains. In this sense, data becomes an element of concern with inquiries such as “Who owns it?” , “Who manages it?” , and “Who is responsible for it?” . Some of these pressures can lead to actions such as continuously screening and monitoring suppliers to evaluate their cybersecurity readiness, investing in encrypting communications and developing robust incident response plans which support the resilience of the whole manufacturing sector. State The regulatory landscape for human-centric manufacturing is still in its developmental phase. Although there is increasing recognition of the need for a human-centred approach within the industry, clear and comprehensive guidelines still need to be developed. This lack of mature legal frameworks creates uncertainty for companies looking to integrate human-centric elements, such as employee wellbeing initiatives, ergonomic designs, and advanced technologies like virtual reality training, which need to be more recognised in many regions due to legal and cultural differences. As a result, manufacturers often need help implementing these practices effectively, especially in diverse legal environments. Similarly, sustainability regulations within the manufacturing sector must be revised due to the slow operationalisatio", "char_len": 5922}

Impacts Changes in legal frameworks and regulations within the manufacturing sector can potentially drive transformative impacts and affect human and societal wellbeing, eco- efficiency best practices, and human-technology symbiosis: • Improved human and societal wellbeing – Changes in regulatory frameworks prioritising human-centricity, safety, and inclusivity in manufacturing can enhance wellbeing for workers and society. These regulations ensure healthier work environments and reduce workplace risks by focusing on ergonomic safety, mental health, and fair labour practices. They also foster job satisfaction and empowerment by valuing workers as active contributors rather than mere operators. Additionally, regulations that emphasise social inclusion can help marginalised groups access better employment opportunities, promoting social equity and cohesion in the workforce. • Increased clarity on eco-efficiency best practices – New legal frameworks that provide more explicit guidelines on eco-efficiency can significantly improve environmental sustainability in manufacturing. By offering specific standards for reducing energy consumption, managing waste, and optimising resource use, these regulations help companies adopt best practices more efficiently. This clarity drives cost savings and operational efficiency and encourages businesses to embrace circular economy principles. In the long term, such regulations can foster innovation in sustainable technologies and strengthen a company’s commitment to corporate environmental responsibility. • Maximise the value of human-technology symbiosis in manufacturing – Legal frameworks supporting human- technology symbiosis will shape how humans and AI work together in manufacturing. The increasing reliance on AI and automation in manufacturing shifts the nature of work from purely manual or routine tasks to a focus on creative problem-solving and innovation. Legal frameworks must evolve to accommodate this transition, ensuring that AI systems augment rather than replace human workers. Regulations can promote training programmes that equip workers with the skills to collaborate with AI systems, transforming them into partners rather than mere operators. As AI becomes a co- worker in creative tasks and decision-making processes, legal frameworks must define clear lines of responsibility and accountability. This includes addressing questions about liability when AI systems make decisions or when errors occur in collaborative tasks. Without legal clarity, there could be confusion over whether humans, machines, or companies that design AI systems are liable for mistakes or failures in production. Responses Futureproofing means crafting laws that evolve with the industry, allowing manufacturers to thrive in continuous change while maintaining ethical standards and promoting long-term sustainability. T o do so, the following vital responses are recommended to reduce pressures and mitigate the potential negative impacts (stifling innovation, unregulated technologies, lack of actionable green strategies): Tackle the risk of overregulation that could bring inertia to innovation practices In an era of rapid technological advancements in manufacturing, legal frameworks must remain flexible enough to support innovation rather than hinder it. Overregulation, where legal restrictions become too stringent or prescriptive, could stifle creative problem- solving and prevent companies from experimenting with new technologies.

Regular dialogue between businesses and regulators can ensure that laws balance protecting societal interests, such as workers’ rights and environmental sustainability while fostering industrial growth. For instance, initiatives connected to ESG issues, reporting processes, and compliance obligations should involve input from all levels of the organisation into the regulatory agencies. This way, it can support cultivating a knowledgeable workforce engaged in sustainability practices and help firms enhance their capacity to meet compliance demands consistently and accurately. Additionally, leadership development programmes in sustainability need to be prioritised to ensure that the needs of the companies are correctly captured and that top management can lead by example and foster a culture of environmental responsibility and ethical governance. A participatory, inclusive regulatory process allows manufacturers to innovate confidently without fearing unpredictable or restrictive legal changes that could jeopardise their competitiveness. Operationalisation of regulations and legal frameworks that lead to human-centric, sustainable and resilient manufacturing companies The key to futureproofing the manufacturing sector is effectively translating legal frameworks into operational realities. It is not enough to have laws in place; these regulations must be actionable and integrated seamlessly into day-to-day operations. Operationalising these regulations might involve setting measurable standards, such as carbon emissions limits or workplace safety benchmarks, and providing companies with the tools and resources to comply effectively. Operationalising these regulations should account for the varying capacities of different-sized companies. For large companies, regulations can include strict measurable standards, like carbon emissions limits or workforce safety requirements, since these organisations typically have more resources to meet such benchmarks. Companies should deploy advanced technologies to reduce energy consumption and decrease carbon emissions in terms of operationalising efforts towards addressing carbon regulations and enhancing energy efficiency across operations. Some initiatives include upgrading to energy- efficient machinery, optimising production cycles to minimise energy waste, and retrofitting facilities with state-of-the-art insulation and lighting systems. Moreover, leveraging smart manufacturing technologies is another strategic response addressing direct and indirect carbon emissions.202 Integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices, automation, and artificial intelligence into manufacturing processes allows for real-time monitoring and precise control of energy use. Also, transitioning to renewable energy sources is a critical response for manufacturers facing stringent carbon regulations. 203 Companies can drastically reduce their reliance on fossil-fuel power by investing in solar, wind, and other installations on-site or through renewable energy certificates (RECs). Large corporations can be mandated to invest in innovation and human-centric practices while supporting smaller companies through partnerships or shared platforms. On the other hand, the legal framework needs to be more flexible and supportive of SMEs and microenterprises, recognising the resource constraints smaller companies face. Legal frameworks should include incentives like subsidies, tax relief, or simplified compliance processes to ensure these businesses can afford to implement human- centric and sustainable technologies. The legal frameworks established today will not only shape the future of manufacturing but will determine how human values, environmental priorities, and technological progress can be integrated.

Industry 5.0’s human-centric approach emphasises sustainability through circular economy practices and Regenerative Manufacturing Systems. It aims to reduce waste, use renewable resources, and maximise societal value while minimising environmental impact. Drivers The global manufacturing sector is driven by several key factors that shape its development and evolution. Economic growth is a primary driver, fuelling the demand for manufactured goods and leading to increased production and resource consumption. As economies expand, manufacturing industries are pushed to scale up operations, adopt new technologies, and explore new markets to meet rising consumer demand. The European Commission, in its industrial strategy, highlights the role of economic growth in driving the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, emphasising the need for innovation and efficiency to sustain growth.204 T echnological innovation is another crucial driver that propels the manufacturing sector forward. Advances in automation, digitalisation, and artificial intelligence are transforming manufacturing processes, making them more efficient, flexible, and sustainable. The European Commission’s focus on Industry 5.0 reflects the importance of integrating human-centric technologies that enhance productivity and contribute to social and environmental goals.205 These innovations are essential for maintaining the sector’s competitiveness in a rapidly evolving global market. Consumer demand for sustainability is increasingly influencing manufacturing practices. As awareness of environmental issues grows, consumers demand eco-friendly, ethically produced, and resource-Environmental actions World Manufacturing Report 2024 78efficient products. This shift in consumer behaviour drives manufacturers to adopt sustainable practices, reduce their environmental footprint, and engage in circular economy initiatives. The European Green Deal underscores the importance of aligning manufacturing activities with sustainability goals to meet consumer expectations and regulatory requirements.206 Pressures The drivers of the global manufacturing sector generate significant pressures that influence how the sector operates and evolves. One of the most pressing challenges is resource depletion. As manufacturing activities increase to meet economic and consumer demands, the extraction of raw materials intensifies, leading to the depletion of finite resources. This pressure is particularly acute for critical raw materials essential for advanced technologies, as highlighted in the European Commission’s Raw Materials Initiative.207 The scarcity of these materials threatens the sustainability of manufacturing processes and raises concerns about the long-term availability of essential resources.

As the demand for raw materials continues to rise, the availability of essential resources is becoming increasingly limited. This scarcity affects the cost and availability of materials and poses a significant challenge to the sustainability of manufacturing processes. The European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan emphasises addressing resource scarcity through improved resource efficiency and adopting circular economy practices. Biodiversity is another critical aspect of the current state of the manufacturing ecosystem. The intensive use of natural resources, combined with the generation of waste and emissions, has led to significant environmental impacts, including pollution, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. The European Green Deal highlights the urgency of addressing these environmental challenges to ensure the long-term sustainability of the manufacturing sector and the broader economy. On a more positive note, ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency are a notable feature of the current state of the manufacturing ecosystem. Manufacturers increasingly adopt energy- efficient technologies and processes to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint. These efforts are supported by the European Commission’s initiatives to promote energy efficiency as a critical component of the EU’s climate and energy policies. Impacts The global manufacturing ecosystem’s pressures and state significantly impact the sector and beyond. One of the most immediate impacts is the increase in operational costs. As resources become scarcer and environmental regulations more stringent, manufacturers face rising costs related to resource procurement, waste management, and compliance with environmental standards. These cost pressures can affect profitability and competitiveness, particularly for manufacturers not fully integrating sustainable practices into their operations.208 The shift to green technologies has another significant impact on the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers are increasingly adopting green technologies and processes in response to environmental pressures and consumer demand for sustainability. This shift reduces the ecological impact of manufacturing activities and positions companies to meet future regulatory requirements and consumer expectations. The European Commission’s focus on green innovation as part of its industrial strategy highlights the importance of this transition for the sector’s future competitiveness. Regulatory compliance challenges also have a significant impact on the manufacturing sector. Navigating the complex and evolving landscape of environmental regulations requires manufacturers to invest in compliance systems, develop new processes, and adapt to changing standards. These challenges can be particularly burdensome for small and medium-sized enterprises, which may lack the resources to manage compliance effectively. Responses Companies are adopting various strategies to promote sustainability and resilience in response to the drivers, World Manufacturing Report 2024 79pressures, and impacts shaping the global manufacturing sector. One of the most effective responses is the adoption of circular economy practices. By reducing waste, reusing materials, and optimising resource efficiency, manufacturers can mitigate the pressures of resource depletion and environmental degradation. The European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan provides a comprehensive framework for integrating circular economy principles into manufacturing processes, highlighting the potential for environmental and economic benefits. The implementation of regenerative manufacturing systems is another critical response. These systems aim to restore ecosystems and minimise environmental impacts by incorporating principles of regeneration and sustainability into manufacturing processes. As the European Green Deal outlines, this approach aligns with ", "char_len": 6190}

By adopting circular economy practices, businesses can reduce costs, contribute positively to society, and increase revenues. Achieving these goals requires the adoption of Regenerative Manufacturing Systems.210 These systems emphasise using renewable, non-toxic, and locally abundant resources, ensuring that processes and products are safe and sustainable. Resource consumption must align with natural regeneration rates, and waste should be minimised or eliminated. When waste is unavoidable, it should be treated to minimise environmental impact. Processes and systems should generate net environmental benefits, restoring natural resources and reversing harmful effects. Additionally, these systems should maximise resource efficiency, prolong product life through durability and reparability, and enable material collection, reuse, and recycling. Ultimately, the goal is to maximise societal value per unit of resource consumed, aligning manufacturing practices with the principles of sustainability and circularity.211 The framework for applying the main principles in the Regenerative Manufacturing Systems is presented in Figure 36. Figure 36 Regenerative Manufacturing Systems (Source: Despeisse, 2023) World Manufacturing Report 2024 80Companies should embrace a spectrum of strategies outlined in the restore-preserve-enhance framework to implement Regenerative Manufacturing Systems effectively. Restore strategies focus on repairing ecosystems after industrial activities, acknowledging the need to mitigate negative impacts. These strategies typically involve minimal changes to business models, aiming to restore ecosystems to their pre-disturbance state.212 Preserve strategies are more proactive, striving to maintain the existing state of ecosystems by ensuring that business activities respect ecological boundaries. This approach often requires adapting business operations to avoid surpassing the ecosystem’s carrying capacity, thereby preserving its functionality over the long term. Enhance strategies go beyond preservation, actively seeking to improve ecosystem health and resilience. These strategies involve innovative, participative approaches that ensure the sustainability of ecosystems and enhance their ability to support life.213 By adopting these strategies, companies can transition from merely minimising harm to generating positive environmental impacts, aligning their operations with broader sustainability goals, and contributing to the long-term viability of the business and the ecosystems they depend on. Companies must incorporate two critical approaches, the Systems-Based Concept and Adaptive Management, to implement Regenerative Manufacturing Systems effectively. The first principle asserts that business sustainability should aim for the sustainability of the entire social-ecological system rather than focusing solely on individual business success. The second principle emphasises the need for an adaptive management approach, which aligns with social-ecological systems’ complexity and dynamic nature. This adaptability ensures that businesses can respond effectively to the evolving challenges within these systems. Technological innovation and changes in consumer behaviours are crucial drivers boosting the creation of more environmentally friendly regenerative manufacturing systems, positioning companies to meet future regulatory requirements and consumer expectations. Drivers Economic growth, technological innovation, globalisation, stricter regulations, and evolving consumer demands are the primary triggers that pressure the global manufacturing sector, pushing it to innovate, adapt, and optimise processes.

World Manufacturing Report 2024 83 capacity are based on flawed data, this can lead to a false sense of control and security and cause leaders to let their guard down, leading to disastrous results. In such a scenario, it is often better not to have advanced forecasting, allowing for a swift response and resolution of upcoming challenges. However, technology adapted in the right way can be an essential component in successfully navigating this VUCA world. In particular, adopting business intelligence and data analytics technologies has the potential to minimise uncertainty, boost adaptability and complexity management, and improve resilience. When adopting these technologies, the devil is in the detail; in this case, that often means data quality. As these data-based and analytical technologies derive insights from available data, focusing on acquiring and managing high-quality data from trustworthy sources is a fundamental requirement for their adoption and usage. Given that (smart) manufacturing today involves complex relationships in supply networks, relevant data resides with different organisations, business units, and market regions. Facilitating data and information exchange requires trust and coordination among supply chain partners, encompassing technical and non-technical data integration and information systems interoperability challenges. The previous point already hints at the need to rethink relationships and corporate culture. T o embrace change in a VUCA world, manufacturing companies may need to re-evaluate their approach to competitiveness. While this does not necessarily mean abandoning the competitive mindset, it may mean rethinking whether collaborating with a perceived competitor benefits both (coopeting) instead of categorically denying such requests. It is a brave new world, and whoever can stay agile and nimble is more likely to navigate it successfully in the long run.EMBRACE CHANGE TO OVERCOME CRITICAL MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES IN A VUCA WORLDEMBRACE CHANGE • Skills: Develop agility, adaptability, and resiliency skills in the leadership team and workforce to respond quickly and effectively to shifting circumstances, including unexpected situations. • T echnology: Embrace business intelligence & data analytics technologies that can assist in minimising uncertainty, boosting adaptability, and improving resiliency. • Culture: Create a VUCA leadership and workforce culture capable of thriving amidst constant change and uncertainty.1. T oday’s global business environment can be classified as volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA). This environment impacts all facets of life and business, from consumption patterns to supply chain and manufacturing operations. In this fast-evolving manufacturing world, resisting change is like swimming against the tide and can be considered futile. A manufacturing company may exhaust all its energy and resources while still being at the mercy of the global paradigm and having difficulty predicting geopolitical, social, and environmental events. In this setting, players who change their perception seem far better at adaptability and using scarce resources than those who do not embrace and resist change as an opportunity. Thus, tackling the emerging grand manufacturing challenges head-on with an open mind is fundamental for achieving continuous growth in a global competitive landscape that calls for rethinking business and operating models and strategies, adopting new advanced technologies, and exploring new markets and consumer needs.

Business insights to anticipate shifts and disruptions and prepare accordingly are new sources of competitive advantage in a VUCA world. As a result, the novel adaptive enterprise model represents the edge of innovation and resilience for manufacturing companies, according to the new digital era. The transition to the adaptive enterprise model, an operating model based on the availability of information and information processing technologies capable of supporting data-driven decisions, makes it necessary to introduce new skills related to the definition, implementation, and application of data-rich models consistent with the business objectives and with the possibility of glimpsing new trends within the available data and information. The necessary skills for its adoption can be classified into three macro dimensions. Of an organisational nature, the adaptive enterprise requires an open and highly collaborative organisational model capable of extending the concept of “the enterprise” outside the company’s four walls and along its entire value chain, known as “the extended enterprise” . The second dimension, linked to data science and the ability to incorporate strategic enterprise (computer) information systems for supporting critical business operations, is of a technological nature. In the adaptive enterprise, constructing a data-rich model capable of representing the company with its assets and business model within its ecosystem, leveraging available information processing technologies, is of fundamental importance. The third and last dimension concerns the managerial nature. In an adaptive enterprise, a managerial model devoted to dynamism and innovation is necessary but simultaneously capable of keeping the company anchored to its mission and founding values. The implementation of the adaptive enterprise model is possible thanks to the correct adoption of the information processing technologies available today, which, in their joint use, allow the capture and conservation of large amounts of data and the extraction of the necessary business insights from it. From here, we move on to actionable information – the ability to use the insights in the strategy planning and execution phase of everyday business operations. As the basis of implementing the adaptive enterprise model, it is necessary to design a precise technological strategy and open a collaborative architectural model to achieve the maximum benefits of business intelligence for the company. A possible approach is based on the creation of a control tower. The control tower model is made up of two areas. Thanks to the collection of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data and information, the first one makes it possible to describe specific conditions along the entire value chain and, with the adoption of big data analytics and artificial intelligence tools, intercepts any disruption while providing decision support to undertake measures to ensure business continuity. The second area of execution allows the recommendations provided by the first area of analysis to be implemented, taking advantage of the capabilities of the adopted information management systems. In a global economic and industrial scenario polarised by big digital players, to ensure their success, manufacturing companies must be able to grasp the challenges and opportunities offered by new digital business and operating models based on the availability of large volumes of data and information and the enabling processing technologies to transform these into revenue. The technologies available today make it possible to implement the adaptive enterprise model, which, thanks to a data science approach, enables the creation of a company capable of adapting to changes in market conditions in line with its own business", "char_len": 5550}

World Manufacturing Report 2024 85 FOSTER INNOVATION AT THE HEART OF MANUFACTURING TRANSFORMATION The present global manufacturing competition arena is changing quickly, and manufacturing innovation is becoming not just a simple catchphrase but more a competitive necessity. At the centre of any outgoing industrial transformations, such as the digital and green transitions, is the capacity for innovation, which profoundly shapes the future of manufacturing industries’ business and operating models and promotes their competitive edge. Consequently, if manufacturers want to remain competitive, they must embrace an ambidextrous innovation approach, with both incremental or exploitative and radical or explorative innovation approaches prioritised and balanced as part of their corporate strategy. A manufacturing company that has consistently prioritised keeping its production operations as efficient as possible over the years may be able to sustain significant profitability. Still, this approach can also result in innovation stagnation, especially when confronted with fast- changing market dynamics and, in some cases, market disruptions. Thus, modern manufacturing companies need to develop a continuous and ambidextrous innovation mindset to break free from this cycle of stagnation. This required mind set entails investigating novel business and operating strategies and experimenting with new product designs and advanced manufacturing processes and technologies. An innovative manufacturing company must be prepared to accept measured risks when exploring contemporary product designs and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and technologies after years of playing safe. For example, an old manufacturing shop floor can be converted into an innovation sandbox to create a place where new manufacturing paradigms are tested or developed and novel product ideas are tried. Manufacturing innovation can flourish in this setting, creating the foundation for a competitive and innovative manufacturing company. T o promote manufacturing innovation, a corporate culture that embraces fresh ideas and perspectives sees setbacks as teaching moments and defines success as the capacity for adaptation and change that must be established. Therefore, encouraging open communication, supporting employee-led initiatives, and recognising and rewarding creative solutions are ways to accomplish this needed cultural transformation. By doing so, manufacturing companies can embrace and foster an atmosphere where innovation is valued highly and engrained into the organisation’s core values. Moreover innovation demands intentional action and dedication from all organisational levels. For creative, innovative ideas to grow, a culture of nurturing and vision setting are essential components of corporate and workforce leadership. It involves fostering a climate where groups can try new things, take calculated chances, and fail forward without worrying about the consequences. T o genuinely promote innovation, a company’s success metrics must change in addition to its leadership. While traditional metrics such as quarterly profits still hold significance, they cannot serve as the exclusive indicators of advancement. Manufacturing businesses must consider new or renewed approaches to evaluate the success of their innovative projects. This could be done, for instance, by keeping tabs on how soon innovative concepts are introduced to the market, how they increase customer satisfaction levels, or even how they create new revenue sources. Manufacturers can then better understand the underlying worth of their innovation activities by expanding the definition of success. Another essential com", "char_len": 5902}

Strategic planning positions manufacturing businesses to remain relevant and improve their competitive standing in the mid-to-long term, have a sustainable path to growth and withstand any unexpected challenges with minimal impact on growth. The manufacturing sector is no outlier in the global business environment in experiencing a significant acceleration in its pace of business. Various factors, including technological advancements, international competition, and evolving customer demands, drive this. The dominant mode of business of the past, featuring lengthy production cycles, rigid processes, and time-consuming strategic planning activities, is challenged by a need for agility and responsiveness directly impacting strategic planning. Manufacturers must avoid falling into the trap of merely reacting to outside stimuli and foregoing strategic planning as this might seem prudent in the short term to manage day-to-day challenges but jeopardises the organisation’s long-term wellbeing. Developing a mechanism that allows the integration of agile and resilient strategic considerations that align with day-to-day demands will distinguish future leaders from companies facing significant competitive challenges. Manufacturers are set in a dynamic VUCA world where product lifecycles are shorter, customisation and personalisation are paramount, and complex global supply networks exist. This accelerated pace of business also brings challenges, such as the need for continuous upskilling of the workforce and the potential for job displacement. Manufacturers must navigate these complexities while focusing on quality, sustainability, and ethical practices to ensure long-term success in this fast-paced environment. T o navigate this environment, the workforce and leadership must cultivate research, analytics, and critical-thinking skills to develop innovative solutions for pressing challenges while at the same time following a viable business strategy. T o compete and thrive, manufacturers must adopt technologies such as automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence to increase the efficiency and resilience of their operations and allow for rapid adaptation to changing market needs. Especially the integration of AI across all layers of the organisation further amplifies this digital transformation, empowering manufacturers to optimise production, predict maintenance needs, and develop innovative products. In today’s fast-paced manufacturing landscape, fostering and actively encouraging a forward-thinking culture is paramount. It has to be engrained in the culture that simply reacting to current trends is no longer sufficient; manufacturers must proactively anticipate and shape the future through strategic planning. This involves investing in research and development, embracing emerging technologies, and cultivating a workforce that is adaptable to change and sees change as an opportunity. By prioritising long-term vision over short-term gains, manufacturers can position themselves at the forefront of innovation, ensuring resilience and sustained growth in an ever-evolving industry.PLAN STRATEGICALL Y DESPITE THE PACE OF DAY-TO-DAY MANUFACTURING BUSINESS OPERATIONSPLAN STRATEGICALLY • Skills: Cultivate research, analytical, and critical- thinking skills in the leadership team to create innovative but viable business strategies and solutions. • T echnology: Use data and technology to improve not only strategic planning but strategy execution. • Culture: Promote a forward-thinking culture, planning for the future, not just for the present. 4. 202420272030 World Manufacturing Report 2024 87 In the VUCA global business environment in which modern manufacturing is set, manufacturers must adopt risk management practices that focus on business continuity and resiliency in the face of disruption and build antifragility capabilities against unexpected future events.

Once potential threat or disruption indicators have been identified, the next step is to develop robust contingency plans. Contingency plans must outline precise procedures for responding to various disruptions, ensuring that production can continue or be quickly restored with minimal impact on customers and profitability. This might involve diversifying suppliers, maintaining strategic inventory buffers, or establishing alternative manufacturing sites. It must be noted that these contingencies are not designed to be 100% prescriptive, but they need to be designed with unplanned events in mind to provide guidance and structure to resolve the challenge at hand. In a VUCA world, risk management is not a one-time exercise but an ongoing, deeply engrained process. Hence, developing skilled risk managers in the leadership team and workforce requires understanding that mitigating risk is essential. Employees must continuously monitor the internal and external environment for emerging risks and adjust their strategies accordingly. This requires a culture of vigilance and adaptability, where employees at all levels are empowered to identify and report potential threats. Leveraging technology, particularly artificial intelligence and data analytics has the potential to enhance risk management capabilities significantly through forecasting and classification. An AI-powered risk management system may predict specific scenarios early with diverse data, from internal production data to global weather indicators and access to unstructured data from social media. This can give manufacturers the necessary edge in activating mitigation actions and thus make the difference between struggling to run the business and outperforming the competition. AI’s ability to analyse vast amounts of data to identify patterns and predict potential disruptions, while data analytics can provide real-time insights into supply network performance and other critical areas, is directly relevant to risk management. However, this task is not trivial and needs organisational leadership and resource commitment. Only by implementing robust risk management practices can manufacturers successfully navigate the future VUCA world. How companies respond to change will differentiate between those striving and growing and those eternally struggling to catch up.IMPLEMENT ROBUST RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL THREATS AND DEVELOP CONTINGENCY PLANSMANAGE RISKS • Skills: Develop skills in the leadership team and workforce to identify, understand, evaluate, and mitigate risks. • T echnology: Leverage analytical technology for predictive analysis and risk assessment. • Culture: Embrace a risk-aware and bold culture that acknowledges and assesses risks, and encourages the development of contingency plans.5.

T o stay ahead of the game, manufacturing companies must dedicate themselves to identifying and implementing the finest practices that will foster operational excellence and innovation. This approach seeks to assist manufacturers in thriving rather than just surviving in a global market where change is happening more quickly. A manufacturer that has dominated its industry for a long time possesses typically refined production techniques and globally recognised products. However, subtle industry changes can surface as new players enter the market with innovative ideas and more flexible production approaches; rivals may provide comparable quality but at lower prices and faster delivery rates.

Furthermore, technology is essential to this development. Even though a manufacturing company may spend money on cutting-edge machinery and advanced software, these assets pay off when they streamline current business processes. Modern technology combined with tried- and-true business strategies can take a manufacturer from adequate to outstanding. Ultimately, the actual industrial transformation starts when a manufacturing company incorporates best practices into its fundamental operations. The entire organisation then develops a culture of constant growth rather than resting on past accomplishments. By taking the initiative and being proactive, manufacturers ensure that they stay one step ahead of their competition, being able to adjust to shifting market conditions and hold onto their competitive advantages. Likewise, encouraging an environment where best practices are valued can spark creativity in unexpected directions. Allowing each leader and worker to exercise critical thought about how their job might be improved can foster small-scale breakthroughs that can significantly improve productivity and product quality over time. Lastly, integrating best practices must be viewed as an ongoing process instead of a one-time endeavour. The procedures that define a competitive manufacturer’s successful business operations should change along with its market and technological advancements. By dedicating themselves to this continuous improvement process, manufacturers may guarantee their survival and sustained success in an increasingly competitive global market.IDENTIFY AND ADOPT BEST MANUFACTURING PRACTICES TO COVER THE BASICS OF COMPETITIVENESSUSE BEST PRACTICES • Skills: Build skills to analyse business processes critically and regularly for the adoption and development of best practices. • T echnology: Use processes and technologies that have reliably led to consistent proven outcomes. • Culture: Nurture a culture of best practices focused on their identification, copy, transfer, and translation between business units, and their promotion. 6. shopshopshop World Manufacturing Report 2024 89 • Skills: Foster green innovation skills in the workforce to identify and exploit opportunities to generate value from green products, services, processes, or business models. • T echnology: Use green technologies and processes to mitigate environmental impacts, comply with regulations, and adapt to new customer expectations. • Culture: Inspire a culture of green innovation focused on the design, engineering, and (re-) manufacturing of environmentally friendly products across their lifecycle. Sustainability is an imperative topic that concerns everyone, manufacturers and their consumers worldwide, out of necessity. Everyone shares this planet with finite resources and must ensure they are preserved for future generations. While most people agree with this sentiment, it sometimes conflicts with the traditional perception of conducting business and manufacturing products that consume finite (raw) materials, energy, and water as production resources. At the same time, a growing world population is becoming accustomed to an unsustainable, consumption-based lifestyle, thus placing even more pressure on already limited resources. On this planet under constant environmental pressure, manufacturing companies seem to face an impossible challenge: satisfying the ever- growing customer demand and successfully navigating the global competitive landscape, all while adhering to sustainability practices. Consequently, everyone must acknowledge to manufacturers and their customers that these sustainable manufacturing and consumption challenges exist. However, these challenges also present a significant, primarily untapped opportunity.

Another factor is the increasing pressure on manufacturers from financial institutions and policymakers to adhere to sustainability practices. While often seen as restrictive and hampering flexibility and growth, it is an opportunity to take a step back and critically assess inefficiencies and other areas for improvement. T oday’s industrial production globally still has significant potential to reduce energy consumption in unison with inefficiencies to improve productivity. In many cases, trying to improve the energy efficiency of a process leads to substantial productivity gains as well. Furthermore, using technology to identify opportunities for improving production processes and supply chains, reducing overall resource consumption, and increasing transparency is becoming extremely beneficial. This fundamental approach has been engrained in the engineering mindset for decades; however, adding the sustainability dimension as an opportunity is a game-changer. This opportunity’s potential positive business impact, presented by adopting sustainability practices more broadly, is significant. It extends beyond the fundamental competitive key performance indicators, and in the war for talent and skilled labour, any organisation that has embraced sustainability as a core value has a leg up on the competition in attracting top talent globally. Overall, in the past decades, the awareness has risen that competitive manufacturing and sustainability must go hand in hand, and this cultural shift inspires the most sought-after talent first, amplifying the positive impact over the long term. APPRECIATE SUSTAINABILITY AS A MANUFACTURING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN PREDOMINANTL Y A CHALLENGEAPPRECIATE SUSTAINABILITY 7. World Manufacturing Report 2024 90 In lockstep with the need to perceive sustainability as an opportunity comes the necessity to innovate and explore new manufacturing technologies to support the accelerating digital-green transition. These manufacturing technologies are understood as being a broad category, encompassing modern digital technologies, such as 5G and cloud computing, and new manufacturing processing technologies, such as 3D printing for lightweight structural components. Overall, in the global manufacturing competitive arena calling for advancing digitalisation and fostering sustainability, new digital and green technologies offer manufacturers the opportunity to support a digital- green transition to smart and sustainable (green) manufacturing systems. When discussing new digital and green manufacturing technologies, the skills gap is almost certainly a significant concern for all manufacturers. Continuously developing and encouraging the adoption of digital skills and literacy across the workforce and leadership team and investing in training on the benefits of a green transition (green skills) is a crucial enabler towards achieving net-zero goals in manufacturing processes and supply chains. Innovation in manufacturing processing technology enables the processing of new materials with desirable sustainability properties like being (bio-)degradable and lightweight and new opportunities to reinvent traditional supply chains. Such is the case of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies that can reduce the need to transport urgently needed spare parts via aircraft by producing these locally and on-demand, thus reducing their associated transport-related carbon footprints. Furthermore, downtime or inefficient use of AM machine tools can be reduced with advanced digital technologies like IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) sensor systems connected through 5G networks for monitoring purposes. Most current manufacturing processes offer the potential to increase their efficacy in one or more dimensions, such as energy, water, or some other resource efficiency.

A vibrant production line, humming with the sounds of gears and the energy of a well-organised team of workers, is where seasoned pros and eager newcomers add to a legacy of quality and creativity. However, as manufacturing industries change and veterans retire, there is a good chance that this passion and productivity could fade away. This hypothetical situation powerfully highlights the significance of a resolute dedication to nurturing the potential of the upcoming workforce generation – a vision for guaranteeing a successful future. A company’s workforce might be just as responsible for its decades-long success as its cutting-edge technology or dominant market position. According to the leadership, every individual in the organisation has potential, from the manufacturing shop floor to the boardroom. They understand that the individuals who operate machinery and innovate with processes and materials are the true architects of the manufacturing sector’s future rather than just the tools or materials themselves. A young, enthusiastic technician who joins a manufacturing company without prior experience may be seen as a simple worker and a future leader. In an organisation that genuinely invests in its future workforce, this technician is nurtured, challenged with complex projects, and provided with solid mentorship. With time, this individual develops into a visionary leader who can guide the company through impending industry issues. This talent- development process may be compared to planting seeds in a garden, which, given the right conditions and care, develop into robust, resilient plants that provide fruit for many years. T echnology is a critical component in this talent-development process pipeline. Manufacturing companies can predict the talents their future leaders will need and ensure those capabilities are being developed today by utilising technologies like talent analytics. T alent analytics acts as an organisation’s roadmap, pointing out the proper route and assisting leaders in avoiding potential talent risks. However, it is essential to remember that the people, their ultimate leadership and growth, remain at the centre of this vision. Lastly, it goes beyond satisfying and sustaining short-term commercial demands to foster future leadership and talent in the manufacturing sector. It is about laying a solid basis for the sector’s long-term (social) prosperity. Competitive manufacturing companies must guarantee that they have the trained staff required to handle the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity of tomorrow’s industrial landscape by promoting continuous learning and providing avenues for career progression. Sustaining a competitive edge in the manufacturing sector requires creating a robust talent pipeline.

INVEST IN BUILDING A TALENT PIPELINE AND DEVELOPING FUTURE LEADERS FOR A STRONG MANUFACTURING SECTOR World Manufacturing Report 2024 92 In the face of grand manufacturing challenges such as sustainable industrial development, “coopetition” offers a competitive strategy combining the advantages of cooperation and competition to bring positive sustainability outcomes to both the manufacturers involved and society. The transition to this highly collaborative and competitive model presupposes the need to build new skills, especially regarding managerial functions. It is necessary to have a leadership that knows how to create dynamic and sustainable partnerships over time, seeing the best growth opportunities for one’s own company and the entire business ecosystem. A wide-ranging leadership is needed to make decisions based on all available information and be able to design short-, medium-, and long- term scenarios. It is then necessary to have the appropriate skills that allow both managers and executive functions to make the most out of the digital technologies available today and to be able to carefully evaluate the future introduction of new ones to increase the value of collaboration. The creation of a highly cooperative model presupposes the possibility, for all the actors involved, of having information representative of the overall corporate ecosystem, the chance of being able to rely on support for strategic decisions, the ability to manage interactions with one’s counterparts and the ability to execute efficiently. Therefore, an organisational model characterised in this way requires a technology adoption strategy that allows the diffusion of capabilities along the entire value chain. This configuration can be made possible by the widespread adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies and best practices currently available. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies enable the building of a digital representation of production assets to ensure their visibility in allocable production capacities. The IIoT also generally allows the digitalisation of all manufacturing processes that use physical assets. Big data allows the collection and storage of large amounts of data and information to accurately represent the events that characterise a value chain and information from organisations’ internal systems and the surrounding ecosystem. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning enable decision support based on available data. These smart algorithms can now be specialised for individual business operation sub-processes, providing essential support. Generative AI provides for the smart automation of tasks that use many human resources, allowing these resources to be freed and scaled, thus reducing costs and execution times. The interconnection between information management systems enables the automation of transactions. In this scenario, the Cloud represents the central technology that allows digital democratisation by reducing technological debt, especially for smaller companies. From a cultural point of view, it is necessary to activate a profound change in current business and operating models. It is essential to move to models that see growth not as an individual objective but as a shared objective along the value chain, including suppliers and customers. In this sense, if until now, business culture has favoured compartmentalised models, looking at partnerships and the relationship with the supply market tactically and opportunistically, the business and operating models of the future must take charge of the shared construction of a highly coopetitive ecosystem, where opportunities for innovation can be jointly developed. Skills and technologies must become familiar and shared assets within the value chains. All actors must participate in creating collective assets, each with their know-how and investments. In this coopetitive model, institutions and academic bodies must not be lacking, as they must act as f", "char_len": 5621}

World Manufacturing Report 2024 93Conclusion The 2024 World Manufacturing Report - New Perspectives for the Future of Manufacturing: Outlook 2030 - has addressed the global manufacturing sector’s most relevant trends and tipping points with a horizon towards 2030. It has analysed in depth the (geo)political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental driving forces that are shaping and will shape the future of manufacturing in the coming y ears. The 2024 World Manufacturing Report has also presented four scenarios for the future of manufacturing beyond 2030, aiming to provide a strategic planning framework for discussion and enable decision-makers to anticipate the upcoming grand manufacturing and supply chain challenges for seizing opportunities more effectively and crafting resilient strategies for an evolving global manufacturing landscape. As it is tradition, the 2024 World Manufacturing Report has provided 10 Key Recommendations for policymakers and industry leaders on how to futureproof manufacturing operations and supply chains in the face of the sector’s present and foreseen volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) business environment. The 2024 World Manufacturing Report has been supported by high-level industrial, government, and academic representatives to guarantee its international authoritativeness. Thus, the Report serves as a whitepaper on the future of manufacturing by providing a set of scenarios, trends, tipping points, and key recommendations that aim to support economic, social, and environmental prosperity for all through manufacturing. In the coming years, the global manufacturing sector will have a short window of opportunity before reaching the different “positive” and “negative” tipping topics discussed in this Outlook 2030, so its industries must proactively act, act now, through industrial transformation to shape a positive and sustainable future for manufacturing and its supply chains by re-designing existing and/or designing new products, processes, and systems capable of achieving the triple-bottom-line and guaranteeing resilience in the face of (geo)political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental challenges that may emerge in the global manufacturing arena. We believe this Report will serve as a valuable strategic planning, forecasting, and business intelligence tool for thriving in a VUCA manufacturing world, where challenges must be faced, risks must be proactively managed, and bold decisions must be made to succeed.

The components in these devices are often not all defective, or not defective at all when the entire product is replaced with a technologically superior one. An example of this arecontrol systems used to distribute signals and loads in automation solutions, or power distribution networks. This use case is a prime example of engineer-to- order manufacturing, where competitiveness in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous business environment is critical. At the same time, the large number of installed components assembled are designed for thousands of switching cycles and experience only a fraction of these in operation. Meanwhile, the assemblies contain metals such as copper and silver or engineering plastics that contribute significantly to the overall carbon footprint of the device. A life cycle assessment of a sample product in use for 15 years shows that the most significant life cycle phase in terms of abiotic resource use is the raw material extraction phase. This is mainly due to the high consumption of copper and the significant sub-processes of operating copper mines, processing sulphide ore and electrolysing copper. For the climate change impact category, the extraction phase (22.2%) and the use phase (74.8%) contribute the most to the total impact, while production and distribution each contribute less than one percent and disposal only 2.3%. Looking at the climate change category, in addition to the use stage, which is primarily influenced by the electricity mix used, the raw material extraction or component manufacturing stage is of particular importance. This observation highlights the significant impact that recycling can have on the product’s environmental profile, drastically reducing climate change-related dimensions. The issue of skills shortages in the industry is highlighted by a 2023 study, which shows that 74% of all companies in this industry are suffering from an acute shortage of skilled workers and are looking for new ways to recruit them. Since the market is undersupplied, improved hiring Patrick Bründl Research Associate & PhD Candidate, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg - YML Milan City Hub practices alone are insufficient. Therefore, efforts are being made to involve semi-skilled workers in the value-added production and assembly steps. For example, in the control cabinet use case, the areas of component placement and electrical wiring are particularly important, accounting for about 66.9% of assembly time. Until now, these steps have been performed almost exclusively by skilled electricians, taking up a large portion of their available time1. The similarity between the two tipping points lies in a common challenge: lack of data. Recycling complex, multi- stage products in high-wage countries is hindered by their unsuitability for automated disassembly. These products often arrive in small quantities, lacking essential data or manufacturer information. Consequently, identifying relevant components or joints for robotic disassembly and planning the initial path is difficult, and manually collecting this data is time-consuming and costly2. A similar problem arises when training unskilled workers. Most companies still rely on schematic diagrams for cabinet assembly, often available only as lengthy printed documents where wired connections are manually checked off. The challenge of this assembly step lies not in the complexity of the assembly tasks but in interpreting the information provided. However, to implement a worker assistance system, such as optical projection, precise position data of components and joints is required. This is not feasible due to the large number of different electronic and electromechanical components, their manufacturers, varied ECAD programs, and differing data standards3.

In addition to the accuracy of the centre points, the alignment of the fixtures is critical for fully automated assembly operations, especially when dealing with flexible elements such as cables. T o evaluate this, the angular deviations and the Spherical Boundary Score (SBS) were analysed. Angular misalignment results of up to 3.00 degrees were achieved, and the SBS of up to 1.75 mm was approximately 45% better than the one from the leading ECAD database5.Conclusion The results show that the approach can fully automate the derivation and computation of urgently needed data for both assembly and disassembly, based solely on the external geometric shape of components. Furthermore, the presented technological approach allows this to be done with sufficient accuracy and data quality to validate the described use cases on an industrial scale. The accuracy is sufficient for optical guidance of the worker, making it easy to operate and follow, even for unskilled workers. The accuracy is also high enough for path planning for automated disassembly, providing a solid foundation for full automation using robotics, where optical or force- based adjustment at the end effector can compensate for any remaining tolerances.

Smart maintenance is a critical field for manufacturers in Industry 5.0, offering the ability to forecast potential equipment failures, enabling timely interventions that minimise downtime and provide actionable response strategies. As we reach a crucial technological tipping point, keeping pace with these emerging technologies is vital for manufacturers to remain competitive in a volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. Leading this technological shift is Generative AI (GenAI), a breakthrough in machine learning and deep learning that generates meaningful content, such as text, images, or audio, based on training data1. The industry is now preparing to integrate this transformative tool and apply it to enhance maintenance practices.

The real strength of GenAI is its ability to create a dynamic learning experience, Siyuan Chen PhD Student, Chalmers University of T echnology - YML Gothenburg City Hub helping workers collaborate with AI systems for more efficient and safer maintenance. Challenges and barriers While GenAI offers transformative potential for smart maintenance, its successful implementation is fraught with significant challenges, particularly in terms of cost, resource investment, and data quality2. Deploying GenAI solutions for smart maintenance can be very expensive, requiring substantial investment in AI infrastructure, including powerful computing resources and robust data storage. Additionally, the expertise needed to develop and maintain these systems, such as data scientists and AI specialists, is both costly and in short supply. For smaller manufacturers or even larger companies with tight budgets, the financial burden of AI implementation can be overwhelming. This high barrier to entry often forces companies to rely on outsourced services rather than developing in-house solutions, which can lead to additional costs and potential dependency on external providers. Also, GenAI’s effectiveness depends on vast amounts of high-quality data, which is often difficult to collect, clean, and maintain. Inconsistent or incomplete data, often siloed across departments, can hinder the accuracy of AI-driven maintenance. Fine-tuning models like “Maintenance GPT” requires well-curated datasets that many SMEs and larger companies may struggle to provide. Poor data quality compromises the precision and reliability of smart maintenance solutions. But the biggest barrier is the uncertainty from the companies. Industries do not really dare to use GenAI at scale because of compliance concerns. Some of them are unsure whether they have the rights to freely use models and the background data that models have been trained on. Also, there are data leaking problems where the confidential data will be trained for the large language models. There is not a clear general law or policy for applying model- and responsibility-related matters. Those kinds of uncertainties lead the maintenance workers to prefer to continue with traditional methods for the time being. World Manufacturing Report 2024 99 Applications There are already several GenAI applications that serve smart maintenance in the industry. For instance, Siemens has launched the Senseye predictive maintenance application, a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that integrates GenAI with machine learning to deliver a comprehensive predictive maintenance strategy3. This tool processes data, retrieves similar cases, and provides actionable insights within a secure cloud environment. By contextualising available information and incorporating concise maintenance protocols, Senseye enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of prescriptive maintenance strategies for its users, leading to more informed and timely decision-making. Additionally, predictive maintenance-related GPT applications have been developed using OpenAI’s technology. For example, the Predictive Maintenance Advisor GPT from 1ai.com is designed to understand and analyse data related to machinery, offering predictive insights that help maintenance practitioners optimise their maintenance practices4. These tools help anticipate issues, reduce downtime, and extend machinery lifespan. Moreover, ChatGPT can assist in creating detailed maintenance reports by following specific prompts and steps, making it easier for maintenance teams to document and track their activities efficiently5. As these technologies continue to evolve, their applications in smart maintenance are likely to become even more sophisticated and integral to industry practices.Outlook As we approach 2030, GenAI is expected to be more deeply integrated into autonomous mainte", "char_len": 5853}

T echnological advancements can be used to address these urgent environmental challenges, but a fundamental shift in society, away from consumerism, is also required. This essay explores how manufacturers can trigger positive tipping points with disruptive technological innovation, like autonomous vehicles, which can challenge the need for ownership. The environmental tipping point Environmental tipping points are critical thresholds in earth’s natural systems that, if crossed, have potentially disastrous and irreversible effects. The tipping points like the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, warm-water coral reefs, the north Atlantic subpolar gyre circulation, and permafrost regions, are at the highest risk of being crossed if the global temperature continues to rise1. Triggering these tipping points could have a severe impact on the security of water, food, and energy, potentially leading to societal instability as resources become increasingly scarce. Global initiatives, like the EU’s Green Deal and the Paris Agreement, are driving changes in manufacturing practices to lessen these threats. These efforts emphasise the urgent need to reduce carbon footprints, prompting manufacturers to use green technologies and sustainable material sourcing. Green technologies, such as electric vehicles, are essential to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as they provide a promising alternative to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines. However, the underlying cause of environmental degradation, namely societal behaviour and consumerism, still need to be addressed. In order to reduce environmental impact effectively, a structural change in societal attitudes toward ownership is necessary. The need for societal structural change The increase in sales of physical products, including vehicles, significantly contributes to environmental Sandra Jakšić Master’s student, Chalmers University of T echnology – YML Gothenburg City Hub degradation. Advancements like electric vehicles and recycling offer some relief, but as long as the demand for new products continues to rise, so will the need for new raw material and energy-intense processes. A societal shift away from ownership is required to break the cycle of overconsumption.

Privately owned cars remain parked approximately 95% of the time, occupying valuable urban space and contributing to inefficiencies in vehicle use3. In contrast, autonomous vehicles can be in constant operation on the road, optimising availability and utilisation. By offering a cost-effective and convenient alternative, Waymo encourages consumers to reconsider the need for owning a personal vehicle. The transportation solution eliminates the burden of parking, maintenance, and World Manufacturing Report 2024 101 the high upfront costs associated with car ownership. The elimination of human drivers also results in a 40% reduction in operating costs compared to conventional ride-hailing services4. Furthermore, the service offers higher personal security compared to public transport, and safety by reducing risks stemming from human error, fatigue, and drunk driving. As Mobility-as-a-Service grows, it is likely to disrupt the traditional automotive market, where personal car ownership has long been the norm. The industry’s shift from selling vehicles to selling travel kilometres will require a fundamental change in business models. Automotive manufacturers are compelled to adapt their products and services, by either in-house development or collaborations, to avoid obsolescence. Adapting to servitisation As manufacturers transition from selling physical goods to offering services, they must adapt both their products and processes to meet the evolving demands. This shift requires companies to realign their operations, placing the customer at the centre of their ecosystem. Businesses must ensure that their services seamlessly integrate with and enhance various aspects of the customer’s life. With the shift towards servitisation, the perception of quality is evolving. Traditional markers such as brand reputation and aesthetics are becoming less important, while factors such as convenience, accessibility, and dependability are taking precedence. As the focus moves from physical products to software and service delivery, companies must prioritise prompt, credible and trustworthy services over the traditional tangible quality of their products. While services present a substantial business opportunity, they also demand a fundamental organisational shift. T o successfully adapt to a service-driven model, manufacturers must establish dedicated business units focused on service development and results. Conclusion T o address the environmental tipping points and remain competitive, manufacturers must harness the synergy between technological advancements and behavioural change. Disruptive technologies, like AI, can create positive tipping points with a shift in consumer behaviour and drive the transition towards more sustainable business models. In doing so, manufacturers will not only contribute to global environmental goals, but also enhance their competitiveness in an increasingly competitive and dynamic market. References 1 T. M.

It is projected that the proportion of people aged 65 and over in the European Union will increase to 30% by 20501. In the United States, one in every five residents will be at retirement age by 20302. These demographic changes directly impact the economy. According to OECD predictions, annual GDP growth in its member countries could decline by 0.5 percent by 2030 due to working- age population decline. Therefore, continuous education and upskilling of the workforce are essential — not only to stay ahead of technological trends but also to improve employee retention and attract top talent. Inclusion efforts targeting 55-64-year-olds, as well as women and migrants who are underrepresented groups, will be needed to mitigate labour shortages. Furthermore, the demand for new skills and job roles is driven by green and digital transitions. According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2023, sustainability and renewable energy specialists are among the fastest-growing roles, and analytical and creative thinking remain the most important skill. Miran Ghafoori EIT Manufacturing Masters student, Aalto University/TU Vienna - YML Gothenburg City Hub Diverse teams and simulation games T eams with knowledge across multiple disciplines can approach problems from various perspectives, leading to more innovative solutions. A diverse skill set also makes employees more adaptable to changing job requirements and industry trends. A 2018 study by Boston Consulting Group found that companies with diverse leadership teams generate 19% higher innovation revenues compared to those with below average diversity. One solution for adapting to evolving job roles lies in educational business simulation games. Participants practice strategic decision-making and problem-solving through managing a production company, helping them develop a holistic understanding of business operations. Research shows promising outcomes Business simulation games are among the most effective and risk-free tools for training and upskilling, offering significant cognitive, behavioural, and affective learning outcomes. According to a systematic review by Vlachopoulos & Makri (2017)3, these games enhance learning by engaging participants in interactive, real- world scenarios. For example, Palmunen et al. (2021)4 demonstrated that after participating in simulation sessions by RealGame.fi, the complexity of users’ mental models increased. Additionally, the percentage of students with misconceptions dropped significantly. How RealGame5 simulates real-world scenarios In aviation, simulators allow pilots to train without the danger and cost of real-world mistakes. Similarly, Real Game provides a safe space for learning to navigate complex scenarios. Participants work in teams of 2-5, with roles such as Production Manager, Procurement and Logistics, or they may share responsibilities. The goal is to maintain balanced operations, profitability and sustainability while adapting to evolving challenges. The game begins with pre-set conditions, and as the simulation progresses, teams must make informed decisions to navigate real-world scenarios, such as: - Supply chain disruptions: These are introduced as unexpected challenges to test resilience and adaptability. World Manufacturing Report 2024 103 For example, if purchased items are not arriving on time, production costs will increase, directly impacting various company KPIs such as production costs, product delivery, and inventory turnover. Some potential solutions are to choose suppliers with higher costs, increased warehousing capacity or more accurate deliveries during disruption times and reduce working production shifts to reduce costs.

For instance, switching to a cloth composed of recycled materials that is more sustainable. While this aligns with environmental goals and meets the growing consumer demand for transparency, it also poses practical difficulties. The shift could involve higher upfront costs and require significant changes to the manufacturing process. Work in progress… Simulation games could be further tailored to training in the manufacturing industry by incorporating circular business models, advanced manufacturing technologies, and AI. By integrating circular business models into simulation games, players can gain hands-on experience in building products for longevity and implement strategies for reuse and re-furbishing6. Furthermore, with the inclusion of advanced manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, players can see their advantages and measure how these technologies reduce costs and demand new skill sets. For example, using 3D printing can enable on-demand production and waste reduction, and increase customer satisfaction. AI systems can enhance learning experiences and provide personalised and automated assessments for facilitators. It is currently the focus of my master’s thesis at RealGame.

Additionally, the trucking sector, which handles the majority of inland freight, has faced challenges including volatile fuel costs, driver shortages and stricter regulatory requirements. Still, inflation has been decreasing and job creation remains healthy as the US economy looks to close 2024 on a positive note. Trends •The demand for qualified drivers remains a top-priority for operators. •Securing advantageous terms on fixed costs like real estate is important in a volatile environment for fuel and spot rate costs.Occupier View Look Ahead •Reducing costs requires new operational models to maintain margins. •Onshoring and nearshoring provide long -term impacts on freight patterns and create new opportunities. FREIGHT TRANSPORT INDUSTRY REPORT The U.S. economy is currently navigating a mixed environment, characterized by slowing growth and persistent inflationary pressures. Despite a resilient labor market, higher interest rates and cautious consumer spending are weighing on economic momentum. Fed Funds Rate/10 -Year Treasury After 11 consecutive rate increases, the US Fed dropped rates 50- basis points in September to provide economic support amid concerns of slowing growth and tightening financial conditions. CPI (All Categories) Inflation dropped to 2.6 percent annual increase to close August, marketing the lowest increase since the onset of the pandemic. Both energy and transportation sector inflation have retreated in the past year. Gross Domestic Product Real GDP has expanded for nine straight quarters, defying expectations for a slowdown over the past 12- months. The recent increases reflect consumer spending, business investment, and inventory investment.

The industry is still grappling with excess capacity post -pandemic which is applying pressure on operators, particularly small trucking companies that rely on margins to stay afloat. Technological advancements and shifts toward sustainability are expected to accelerate, providing new growth opportunities. However, ongoing labor shortages for qualified drivers, regulatory pressures and fluctuating fuel/energy prices are obstacles for the trucking industry. Investing in new technologies, building strong partnerships, and exploring new operational models to maintain margins will keep operators ahead of the curve. Speed to customers remains the lone non- negotiable factor that will require logistics companies to keep pace. Understanding customer demand and consumer trends will be paramount in growing market share.

Organizations are now instilling safeguards to manage this disruption through technological improvements as well as changes to organizational structure, cultural norms, and priorities. But the real winners will be those organizations that can not only manage their business functions through what I call “perpetual disruption,” but actually use it as a catalyst for growth. I believe SCIP is best suited to provide the insight, knowledge, and experience our members need to use competitive and business intelligence to help their organizations grow. And by working with partners in the intelligence ecosystem, SCIP is positioned as the cornerstone of the global intelligence thought leadership community. To that end, I am honored to introduce the State of Competitive Intelligence. This report showcases key learnings around CI disciplines and practitioners, and reinforces the fact that organizations with intelligence disciplines are better equipped in times of “perpetual disruption” .There are 3 major points around CI and related intelligence- driven economies that will drive a successful strategy: • A data-driven mentality is critical in the development of CI initiatives and plans • Strategic decision-making needs to happen as close as possible to the time that new intelligence is revealed • Organizations need to pivot their line of value to alternative/related outcomes in order to efficiently use intelligence to meet changing customer demand. With the proper alignment of intelligence strategists and this knowledge around data-driven insights combined with executive-level decision-makers, you can create a truly world- class strategy. I believe we are in the midst of a profound role transition, in that people at all levels of the intelligence profession are becoming critical to organizational growth and wellness. It’s an exciting time to be in this field. I look forward to working with each of you in the SCIP community. My sincere best, Paul Santilli Our favorite findings from this year’s survey include... Since 2021, we’ve seen a 55% increase in the share of stakeholders who say competitive intelligence is “absolutely critical” to their success. 99% of the stakeholders who completed our survey this year said CI is at least “somewhat important” to their success. For the average software company, 66% of sales opportunities are competitive. Fortunately, most CI leaders understand how crucial it is to enable sellers with competitive intel: 64% say sales is a very important CI stakeholder group, and 56% are using win/loss analysis to determine where their enablement efforts are most needed. 88% of CI stakeholders want regular updates on their competitive landscapes—ideally on either a weekly or monthly basis (only 9% want quarterly updates, and even fewer want daily updates). At this point, only 70% of CI leaders are fulfilling this desire for regularity. Since 2018, we’ve seen a 125% increase in the share of CI leaders who say they’re measuring the success of their programs with key performance indicators (KPIs).

In the ensuing 20 years, many individual fintechs have come and gone. Others have become integral components of financial services, but the true lasting legacy of fintech is the staggering impact on our day-to-day lives and our financial systems. And there is so much more room for growth. With the advent of game-changing technologies such as GenAI and with still billions of unbanked and underbanked individuals worldwide, we reaffirm our forecast from last year’s report : we are still only in the second chapter of a longer story and fintech has vast untapped potential. But the rules of the game are changing. The current fund - ing chill, once passed, will leave in its wake an environment in which fintechs must invoke a different set of capabilities to succeed and thrive. Prudence—the ability to avoid add - ing risk to the financial system—will be as important as the ability to generate profitable growth. The prize, and the rewards for customers, will be as significant as ever, but the path to success will be markedly more difficult. We spoke to more than 60 global fintech CEOs and inves - tors to understand their views on the future of the sector. Combined with our own experience in the industry, these perspectives inform this report. We see nine distinct trends shaping the current fintech landscape, some new, some long-standing. Coming out of these underlying trends, we see four major themes that fintechs and incumbent banks will need to confront given that these themes are of grow - ing and critical importance for the sector. Finally, we will explore five imperatives for players in the new fintech ecosystem that has begun to emerge.Introduction BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + QED INVESTORS 4Key Highlights With billions of unbanked and underbanked people worldwide and GenAI’s boost to productivity, the potential for fintech remains vast—we expect a fintech market size of $1.5 trillion in revenue by 2030, up from $300 million today. The new watchword is prudence . Fintechs need an end-to-end view of compliance— preemptively assessing applicable regulations and proactively implementing industry- grade guidelines and controls. With connected commerce, major banks finally have an opportunity to leverage their vast data on customer needs and behaviors.Global fintech revenues have continued to grow at a robust clip—14% annually over the past two years. The biggest performance gap is found between top- and bottom-quartile fintechs across segments. With Pix and UPI, respectively, Brazil and India have led the way in using digital public infrastructure to broaden access to financial services and spur innovation. But the success of DPI hinges on its comprehensiveness and its full integration across systems. GenAI is delivering huge productivity gains in precisely the areas where fintech costs are centered: coding, customer support, and digital marketing. Fintechs, relative to other financial services players, will reap the biggest productivity rewards in the near term. Fintechs need to— and can—improve EBITDA by more than 25 percentage points. Getting there will require a scalable cost structure that will deliver compounding returns as a fintech grows. Digital challenger banks are star performers.

Coming off the highs of 2021, revenue multiples have fallen from 20 times to 4 times on average, and funding is down by 70%—and almost 50% in the last year. (See Exhibit 1 .) The declines are heavier in some areas than in others. Late- stage investments (series C to E+), for example, are down by 81% to 89%, compared with 54% to 73% for early-stage funding rounds. Overall, funding is down by at least half for all fintech segments except insurance and payments. However, we believe these challenges are part of the short- term correction—a tempering of investor enthusiasm—we discussed in last year’s report and that those challenges are now beginning to abate. The Funding Winter Continues, but So Does Growth There is no shortage of capital in fintech. There was just an overabundance in 2021.

Growth during the two-year period comprising 2022 and 2023, in fact, compares well with the 29% rate from 2019 through 2023.

We continue to expect fintechs to reach a market size of $1.5 trillion in revenue by 2030—growth of roughly five times over the period from 2023 to 2030. Fintechs still maintain and press their well-known advantages: a laser focus on solving customer pain points, compelling user experiences, and rapid innovation. These strengths will continue to power growth—even as the regulatory playing field is becoming more balanced and equitable, presenting a challenge of sorts for many fintechs, which have until recently operated under the regulatory radar. The upside for fintechs continues to be vast—with 1.5 billion unbanked and 2.8 billion underbanked adults across the world. Of course, these potential customers are also available to incumbent banks, which will have their own opportunities to grow. The question is whether—and how—they will do so. The emergence of new technologies seems to favor fin - techs, at least in the near term. GenAI , for one, is proving to be an immediate boon for the sector, already delivering huge productivity gains in precisely the areas where fin - techs’ costs are centered: coding, customer support, and digital marketing (with improved targeting). GenAI, along - side API-based connectivity and distributed ledger technol - ogy, will provide a rapid boost for fintechs; banks, too, will benefit from these technologies, but over a longer time scale. In short, GenAI arrives at a moment when many fintechs are strapped for cash. It may well keep a number of them afloat while they address the pressing need for profitable growth.

Nubank, for example, crossed the 100-million-user milestone in May 2024 and aspires to become Latin America’s largest and most profitable bank in the near future—roughly one in two adult Brazilians is a Nubank customer. Meanwhile, in Europe, Monzo reached operational profitability in the first half of 2023 and recent - ly received additional funding to fuel its ambitious global growth plans. More than half of the profitable challenger banks are located in Asia—South Korea’s KakaoBank, for example—often as part of an integrated ecosystem.Notably, there is no single recipe for a successful challeng - er bank.

Regulatory actions have included consent orders against several fintech sponsor banks, increased scrutiny of banking as a service (BaaS) overall, moves against crypto firms, and the proposal from the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on the supervision of big tech companies and other providers of digital wallets and payment apps. Though much work remains to create a level and fair regulatory operating environment for banks and fintechs, we believe things are trending in the right direction. 3. The Emergence of New Regulatory Frameworks Globally. Regulatory frameworks and standards governing or impacting the global fintech sector have been coming into focus. India, for example, has released new notifications to reemphasize and clarify know-your- customer (KYC) and co-lending standards for fintechs, and the CFPB is currently gearing up to develop concrete guidelines under Section 1033, a part of the Dodd-Frank act aimed at clarifying rules regarding how customer data is accessed and used. 4. The Global Proliferation of DPI. Digital public infrastructure has accelerated the adoption of real-time payments in countries including India (whose DPI is Unified Payments Interfaces, or UPI) and Brazil (Pix). (See Spotlight #2 .) This three-tiered infrastructure—a national digital identity system, a payments layer, and a data exchange—creates a fertile context for fintech development. Many countries, particularly emerging markets, are looking to emulate the success of UPI and Pix. However, while the success of the India and Brazil DPIs is unequivocal, it is by no means certain that other countries—including developed markets—will be able to replicate it. Much depends upon the current market context and the maturity of the various layers.Where the regulator has stepped in to define a framework, it’s caused a huge, dynamic change in the market. When the regulator provides clarity, as in crypto and AI underwriting, all stakeholders can build more constructively.

Heightened Attention on Fraud and Cybersecurity. As real-time payments and GenAI become increasingly integral parts of consumer financial services, the risk of fraud ramps up. In the US, for example, incidence of data compromise increased by 78% in 2023, up to a record of 3,205 incidents broadly, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center. According to a 2024 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network report, more than 40% of Bank Security Act reports in the US were related to identity fraud, with $212 billion in suspicious activities directly resulting from failures in bank identity verification.1 New threats, such as the adoption of deepfake technologies— where AI is used to create fake videos or other media that seem real—can erode fundamental trust as much as they do our financial systems. 6. The Acceleration of Scaled GenAI Adoption. The adoption of GenAI will accelerate, with primary near- term use cases related to productivity and marketing. A number of fintechs—including PayPal and Klarna— are putting GenAI front and center in their operating models, automating customer service, checkout, and personal recommendations. We believe product innovation through GenAI is on the horizon but will not make a difference in the near term. 7. The Continued Embedding of Financial Services. The embedding of financial workflows into nonfinancial journeys continues to expand and will only increase as more and more customer activities become digitized across both B2C and B2B. 8. The Effect of Mainstream Banks “Crossing the Rubicon” on Advertising. While banks have long had proprietary access to valuable customer data, few have taken the step of monetizing that data through advertising. Mainstream banks such as Chase are joining fintechs in using their first-party data to surface relevant ads in their own closed commerce sites. 9. The Reemergence of the IPO and M&A Markets. Following a funding winter, we expect that the need for liquidity, and fairer conditions in capital markets as interest rates moderate, will lead to a substantial uptick in IPO and M&A activity for fintechs.Fraud is a huge issue for everyone, everywhere. Fraud is a natural part of payments, but once it becomes too much, it’s a problem. More government support is key, but as fintechs we must work together to tackle this problem.

These players, and others, continue to expand use cases, includ - ing pay by bank, acceptance of cryptocurrency payments, and use of digital assets. (See Spotlight #3 .) While not as mature as other segments of the fintech market, embed - ded lending, including buy now pay later (BNPL) players, saw robust increases in transactional volume, with Klarna accounting for $90 billion and Affirm for $20 billion. Correspondingly, embedded insurance has a strong growth outlook; adoption in Europe is already strong, with roughly $8 billion in premiums in 2023. This is only the beginning. We expect an embedded finance market size of more than $320 billion in revenue in 2030, with the small and medium-size business (SMB) segment accounting for about half ($150 billion), as both vertical and horizontal independent software vendors (ISVs) respond to the segment’s unmet demands. Horizontal solutions will play an increasing role—for instance, in accounting software that offers payroll services and work - ing capital loans. Meanwhile, banks are increasingly offer - ing end-to-end solutions that include accounting. The consumer segment—already humming with activity and adoption in payments, insurance, and lending—will be worth $120 billion revenue by 2030. Embedded finance will grow to a market size of $50 billion revenue in the enterprise segment, where horizontal soft - ware is increasingly embedding payments, lending, and trade to address continuing pain points in accounts payable and receivable. We see financial services embedded into B2B platforms and supplier networks, with increasing use of value-added services including cashflow forecasting and spending-management tools. The burning question: Is this profit pool reserved primarily for fintechs, or will incumbent banks find a way to claim a significant share? In the near term, we expect that estab - lished fintechs will continue to reap the lion’s share of the benefits while larger, more established banks will gain share over time. The growing scrutiny of bank-fintech partnerships will tip the balance of economics toward those banks that have the robust risk management and control capabilities necessary to oversee fintechs and establish strong partnerships.Embedded finance continues to grow apace. We are squarely in the third inning of embedded finance for vertical software, but we’re still in the first inning for other functions, such as the office of the CFO. This is the light dawning, not a fad. MATT HARRIS, PARTNER, BAIN CAPITAL VENTURES In the wake of crypto’s most recent turbulence, many have questioned if digital assets more broadly could make a credible return. Despite recent short-term volatility, inter - est in digital assets remains immense, with proponents seeing it as the next evolution of money and some expect - ing it to power growth in the broader global economy. Digital asset technology includes central bank digital currencies (CBDC), stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, as well as unified ledger use cases that support broader tokeniza - tion of assets and deposits. A number of recent trends are underway in the market. For example:• Globally, CBDCs are developing rapidly, with the majority of central banks proactively researching or launching pilots. • Investment in stablecoins is significant, with proponents focused on the technology’s ability to settle cross-border payments instantaneously, increasing efficiency and lowering transaction costs. PayPal’s recent introduction of PayPal USD stablecoin for money transfers is a case in point. • As with fintech more broadly, cryptocurrencies are benefiting from recent regulatory clarification and a formalization of institutional investing including the use of bitcoin ETFs. • Unified ledger is emerging as a potential new financial market infrastructure, providing the benefits of tokenization by combi", "char_len": 5254}

This has long been understood as an advantage, but it is one that has not yet been fully realized. However, if there is a killer app for converting this proprietary data into a revenue generator, it is connected commerce. With the increasing value of first-party data, given cookie depreciation and app-tracking transparency, connected commerce is emerging as a triple play for banks—it creates a new revenue stream, increases customer loyalty, and enables banks to offer a marketing channel to their SMB and enterprise customers. Connected commerce thrives in an environment in which customers have a high degree of digital engagement— either on websites or on mobile apps. Using granular cus - tomer data, banks can strengthen customer loyalty by surfacing ads hypertailored to the individual. Merchants then pay the bank based on either attributable sales or traffic—creating a win-win-win scenario where the custom - er is rewarded, merchants generate more sales, and banks earn revenue. As core payments revenue streams, like interchange and late fees, continue to come under pressure, and as deposits risk becoming commoditized in a higher- yield environment, connected commerce hints at a future model for banks. Major financial institutions with sufficient scale are investing in the approach: see JPMorgan’s Chase Media Solutions, Capital One Shopping, and Citi Shop. Select fintechs such as Klarna have also invested in con - nected commerce, and both Revolut and PayPal recently announced the launch of advertising businesses.Apple, too, may be eyeing connected commerce. (See Spotlight #4 .) The area is fertile ground for partnerships between fintechs and banks. Fintechs bring the speed and user experience, and banks bring the customers and the data. For example, Citi partnered with Wildfire Systems, a B2B2X fintech, to create Citi Shop. A cautionary note here, for banks and their partners, is the risk that all this pinpoint ad targeting could turn the advertisers into the customers, and the consumers into a product to serve the needs of advertisers, eroding brand loyalty.

(See the exhibit below.) Apple has executed a seamless rollout within its ecosystem. Nevertheless, the uncertain future of its partnership with Goldman Sachs, heightened regulatory attention, and the recently filed US Department of Justice antitrust suit citing noncompetitive practices (specifically calling out Apple Wallet) will likely dampen the company’s appetite in the short term.We see many consumer banking products as fair game, as long as they align with Apple’s core beliefs: increasing stickiness of core products, supporting the product upgrade cycle, enabling its services strategy, and contribut - ing high margins. Accordingly, self-directed investing and connected commerce within Apple Wallet are two areas to watch going forward.

BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + QED INVESTORS PRUDENCE, PROFITS, AND GROWTH 17Open Banking Will Have a Modest Impact on Banking but a Greater One on Advertising Open banking will continue to expand as more countries implement customer-permissioned access to their finan - cial data, enabled by APIs. However, while open banking will drive innovation (in underwriting and customer expe - rience, for example) and increase financial access, it is unlikely to change the basis of competition in banking. In fact, in countries where open banking has had a decade or more to mature, no killer use case has emerged. Asserting that open banking is unlikely to make a splash is different from saying it will have no impact. More than 65 countries have instituted open banking—to some degree or other—and we expect the trend to continue.2 Approaches have varied, with some jurisdictions taking a market-led approach (until recently, the US was a good example; regu - lation will now be implemented through the CFPB 1033 ruling), and others, such as the EU with the third Payment Services Directive (PSD3), shaping open banking through regulation. In some Asia-Pacific countries a hybrid approach has emerged, with collaboration between regulators and the private market; South Korea is an example. In select areas, open banking has delivered changes that have then enabled innovation and better customer experi - ence; for example, access to account information has allowed new entrants to effectively underwrite credit to non-primary customers. But overall the impact has been modest. Open banking has been live in the UK for six years, and consumer adoption has plateaued at 12% monthly active users. Even in the Nordics, traditionally in the vanguard of digital adoption, open banking user pene - tration is well below 50%—for example, roughly 30% in Sweden and 25% in Norway.3 What would it take for open banking to have a bigger impact on banking? If bank account numbers were as porta - ble as mobile phone numbers, switching would become significantly easier. However, the question still remains whether access to banking data allows for the creation of a new and differentiated value proposition. Beyond traditional banking use cases, we do expect that opening up access to transaction-level data could have an impact on advertising and connected commerce more broadly. We believe that open banking will continue to be a rele - vant but not game-changing factor in consumer and SMB financial services and fintech. Revenue pools in the con - nectivity layer, retrieving and managing data that banks are mandated to provide, will remain modest, with value accruing to the ultimate use-case providers leveraging open banking infrastructure. These use case providers will, however, often use proprietary APIs, with higher data granularity and breadth, supplemented by access provid - ed by open banking, and will not rely on screen-scraping or alternate methods used to gather the same data today.In Korea, open banking has lowered the barrier to access financial data.

Both fintechs and incumbent banks are using GenAI in customer service and support; in soft - ware coding, testing, and documentation; in the regulatory arena, through filings and compliance; and for targeted, automated digital marketing. The applications and impact will only grow. Specifically, we see increased efficiencies for banks and fintechs across COGS (for example, higher developer and service operations productivity), in sales and marketing (increasing speed to output for content creation and improving salesforce effec - tiveness), and in general administrative expenses (optimizing third-party spending, simplifying the tech stack, and automat - ing support functions). For fintechs in particular, given that their “digital first” cost structures are heavily weighted toward areas where GenAI is delivering huge gains—coding, custom - er support, and digital marketing—the impact is likely to be even more pronounced in the near term. (See Exhibit 5 .)The use of GenAI in product innovation will lag its uses for productivity—but we expect it to follow. We do see a future for the technology particularly in personal financial man - agement, where large language models can better assess and customize recommendations for things like savings advice and suggest ways for customers to achieve their financial goals. Along with its benefits in productivity and innovation, GenAI can help financial institutions in achiev - ing end-to-end transformation into more effective, strate - gic, and competitive organizations. A focus on responsible AI and ensuring that appropriate governance, risk management, and controls are in place are table stakes for the application of GenAI. We think it is safe to say that the pervasiveness of GenAI will raise the bar, and that risk management in GenAI will become a differentiator for players that successfully scale. Forward- thinking fintechs and banks will invest now in these capabil - ities and governance. The GenAI ecosystem will also inevitably make room for new vertically focused innovators to emerge that will help banks and fintechs accelerate their adoption of the technology.We believe there is strong potential for GenAI for productivity use cases such as customer support, fraud risk management, onboarding, and copilots for developers. It will also provide value by better automating payment method recommendations for different country and ATV [average transaction value] use cases.

For banks, which are used to operating in a stringent regula - tory context, the call to action is to reinforce and lean into their existing compliance strengths. As they prepare for an era of increased collaboration with fintechs, they should focus on their due diligence capabilities and firm up their third-party oversight management processes. This is espe - cially germane in the US, where the Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships requires taking direct oversight of compliance and risk activities and ensuring that robust monitoring is in place for bank partnerships with fintechs. A number of major US banks, including global players such as JPMorgan and Citi as well as regional players such as Fifth Third Bank and KeyBank, have used their strengths in compliance and risk management to structure strong partnerships with fintechs and subsequently even acquired them—showing that an approach that benefits all parties can be constructed. Profits: A Call for Fintechs to Improve EBITDA by More Than 25 Percentage Points For many fintechs, profitability fell off the strategic radar during the heady days of near-zero interest rates. This hang - over remains, and only 33 of the 70 largest public fintechs were profitable in 2023. While this was an improvement over 2022, it says something about the health and prospects of the sector that fewer than half of the public fintechs are sustainably profitable. Based on our research and practical experience, we believe that fintechs need to—and can— improve EBITDA by more than 25 percentage points. Of course, fintechs are wading through the difficulties of a high-interest-rate environment—which has put unit costs front and center. In this context, a disciplined approach to costs will be the difference between operational profits and losses. There are players that have focused on unit profit - ability—to their benefit. Challenger banks in particular have achieved positive operational profitability, positioning them advantageously to scale despite the context of con - strained funding.Across the board, public fintech costs are roughly split into COGS at 30% to 60%, sales and marketing (10% to 40%), and general and administrative costs (10% to 30%). Top- quartile players in terms of EBITDA outpaced bottom-quar - tile firms by roughly 25 percentage points in 2023 in each of these cost categories. While this is sobering for the laggards, it speaks to significant opportunity for tangible cost savings industry-wide. The numbers tell us there is plenty of margin to streamline operations and edge toward profitability. We don’t suggest that lagging fintechs apply a blunt instru - ment to their cost structure; rather, they should focus on building a scalable cost structure that will deliver com - pounding returns as they continue to grow. An effective transition to profitability calls for a multipronged approach that includes both revenue growth and cost reduction, along with balance sheet improvements: • Revenue growth levers include pricing, particularly new revenue models for pricing for payments (for example, basis points, fees) versus software-as-a-service-type subscription models to yield more revenue. Fintechs should also focus on salesforce effectiveness and commercialization efforts, which include defining vertical versus horizontal client segments and aligning go-to- market strategies against them. • Cost reduction levers are evergreen, but many fintechs have yet to apply them comprehensively. Organizationally, a redesign that eliminates layers and redefines role charters can have significant cost implications, while front-to-back digitization of operations—particularly increasing automated decision making regarding key processes—can yield savings. Cost leaders also focus on procurement excellence—that is, optimizing and consolidating key contracts. In central, support, and technology functions, optimization and simplifica", "char_len": 5340}

(See Exhibit 6 .) Leading fintechs in all geographies have made known their intent to go public in the near future, from Flutterwave in Africa to Klarna in Europe; from Airwallex in Asia-Pacific to Chime in North America. BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + QED INVESTORS PRUDENCE, PROFITS, AND GROWTH 21But fintechs must be careful what they wish for. Many have made the IPO leap only to see their stock prices drop later by as much as 40% to 80% from their initial listing. Investors have changed their tune, singing the praises of sustainable, profitable growth where they once exhorted fintechs to “grow at all costs.” Consequently, the bar has shifted, put - ting more pressure on fintechs to tell a longer-term and more comprehensive equity story. In this context—to maxi - mize valuation for IPO and beyond—fintechs need to focus on best practices: • Tell a clear equity story. Early fintechs could go a long way with a simple, elegant solution to a customer pain point. Today, investors expect a more comprehensive narrative, an articulate story that clearly lays out the case to underwrite long-term success. Yes, it remains critical for aspiring public fintechs to detail how unmet customer needs will be met and exactly how the current landscape will be disrupted. But as investors look for sustainable long-term investments, they will need greater detail. How will the fintech attract users at sustainable costs, and what is the plan for profitable growth? How is it positioned to meet increasing regulatory compliance requirements? • Move when the time is right. Before IPO, fintechs first need to achieve enough scale, operational stability, and predictability to justify the costs and scrutiny that come with going public. To get there will require a focus on fundamentals. The imperatives here are not particularly new, but until now they have not been as critical to a fintech’s success or failure. Fintechs that thrive in the new environment will be those that apply a laser focus to unit economics and optimize costs, revenues, go- to-market strategies, risk and compliance capabilities, and partnership models. By doing so, they prepare themselves to scale in a profitable and predictable way.• Build compliance muscle. In addition to the cost and revenue levers detailed earlier, fintechs can prepare for a successful IPO and beyond by taking a robust, end-to- end view of compliance to mitigate the risk and impact of future regulatory actions and give potential partners confidence in the viability of joint efforts. This is not something that can be successfully pulled together a few months before IPO. We recommend fintechs operate as if they were a public company for five quarters before the launch. • Prepare to partner. Fintechs should devote significant leadership attention to partnership strategy more broadly, as we expect significant ongoing opportunities for fintech-bank alignment. Those fintechs with strong balance sheets and controls, and with superior capabilities in partnership building and business development, will be positioned to make the most of these rich opportunities. The earlier a company creates a schematic around its equity story and communicates the key metrics that it expects Wall Street to grade it against, the likelier it is to maintain its valuation beyond the initial offering. For exam - ple, when it went public in January 2021, Affirm had clearly laid out its business model as an alternative to traditional lending but had also reported 77% year-over-year growth in gross merchandise volume, an NPS of 78, 6.2 million con - sumers, and the number of merchants using its platform (6,500).4 It made clear its status as a licensed lender in the US and described its ongoing plans for adapting to federal and state lending regulations. 4.

BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + QED INVESTORS PRUDENCE, PROFITS, AND GROWTH 22Growth: Retail Banks as Digital Engagement Platforms Amid the excitement of fintech innovation, it has been easy to forget that banks have distinct advantages in their proprietary access to customer data and their high customer engage - ment. It has long been understood that banks were sitting on a gold mine of customer data, but examples of banks putting that data to profitable use have been less common. The killer app may have arrived. To provide a counterweight to fintechs that embed financial services into nonbanking journeys, banks are developing their own commerce sites, where they can leverage their vast insights into customer needs and behavior to pinpoint offerings and rewards. (See Exhibit 7 .) It is a bit like shifting the battle to a “home court” where banks have the advantage, especially given their significant customer bases. Despite the common perception of banks as digital laggards, many enjoy higher consumer engagement than their fintech counterparts and should build on that. Where fintechs have outplayed banks thus far is in converting that engagement into shopping behavior. In many cases, connected commerce platforms will suc - ceed or fail on the quality of partnerships between banks, fintechs, and merchants—the classic win-win-win scenario. But this raises the bar—particularly for fintechs—for the quality of their compliance capabilities and ease of integra - tion with banks. Fintechs need to be able to hit the ground running with confidence—as do their potential partners. The new generation has been raised on fintech products. In many cases they’ve never gone to a branch—they’re truly digital natives who may have used only virtual cards.

(See Exhibit 8 .) Many countries have tried to emulate the success of the two leading players: India’s UPI and Brazil’s Pix. However, the limited success of these efforts reveals that isolated implementations of point solutions for digital identity or real-time payments systems do not suffice to foster wide - spread adoption. Instead, governments should lay out the set of interoperable protocols and put in place fundamental enablers on which innovation can then occur. For example, a real-time payments infrastructure is now commonplace, with more than 70 countries having one in some form.

NPCI, UPI Product Statistics, reported April 2024. BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP + QED INVESTORS PRUDENCE, PROFITS, AND GROWTH 24We are entering a world where the recipe for success for fintechs has more ingredients: prudence as table stakes, profitable unit economics, and robust customer growth. This shift has implications for all fintechs, particularly as they emerge from a funding winter hungry for investment. For fintechs targeting an IPO, the path has become more complex: investors are still looking for that fintech magic— elegant solutions to pain points still all too prevalent in financial services—but they also want a clearer, almost granular, narrative on how a company plans to achieve long-term profitable growth. For all fintechs, public and private, and for the banks that compete with them, a firm grasp on cost and revenue levers will be a necessity. We also believe that the future will see greater levels of cooperation and partnership between fintechs and incum - bent banks—the opportunities for mutually beneficial alignment are just too numerous and potentially reward - ing. In a world where embedded finance, connected com - merce, and all the shades in between become norms, well-developed muscles in partnership and compliance will be just as important as skills in innovation, technology, and marketing.The fintech landscape is flush with success stories across the globe. In India and Brazil, we are seeing perhaps a vision of the future in their DPI models—one in which regulators walk a fine line by encouraging and fostering innovation while protecting consumers. We see banks finally finding an effective and value-adding way of leverag - ing their customer data through connected commerce. And in GenAI, we see an almost custom-made productivity lever that may be enough to keep some fintechs in the game long enough to find their footing. A “back to basics” theme runs throughout this year’s report. But this does not mean the excitement of the fintech era is over. Formula 1 engineers prioritize improve - ments to the braking system to help maximize time spent at higher speeds throughout the course.

By maintaining a laser-focus on the right target audiences, and creating offers that address those people’s specific needs, aspirations and pain points, brands can attract an increased share of consumer spending, even in a tough global market. 3 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024Business landscape This year could receive a boost from a number of big events taking place. On the social side, the Summer Olympics and Euro 2024 soccer tournament both have the power to boost spending, as fans’ euphoria meets with the marketing and sales promotions surrounding these types of major sporting events. On the political side, eight of the 10 most populous countries around the globe (including India, Brazil and United States) are set to hold elections this year. The run- up to these may well see optimistic market conditions as incumbent governments seek to win voters with economic stimuli. With economic indicators such as inflation and job markets continuing to stabilize in 2024, shopper confidence is improving, although still at historically low levels. This improvement shows regional variation, with consumers in China and USA showing only small gains, compared to the average across all OECD countries. 01 Business landscape 4 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024Business landscape Historical Average = 100Nov 22 Oct 22 (China) vs Oct 23 (China)Nov 23USA 96.9 97.1Europe area 96.2 98.1China 93.0 93.3OECD 96.2 98.0According to the World Economic Forum’s survey of chief economists, Europe is the region that most economists fear will see weak economic growth and high inflation this year, followed by North America.

Source: NIQ Consumer Outlook January 2024 12 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024Where the opportunities lie Where the opportunities lie04 2024 is all about producing the best value for consumers at the right price, as manufacturers and retailers compete harder than ever to win the battle for mental and physical availability. With money-conscious consumers continuing to shop around and weigh up every purchase, it can be tempting for brands to discount prices to drive volume of sales. We saw this last year, with the top seven annual promotional events* including brand events increasing in duration to cover 15 weeks of the year – up from 11 weeks in 2019 (*Christmas, New Year, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, 618 and Double-11, Apple event, Prime Days). However, competing on price eats into margins and risks getting sucked into price races. 13 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024Where the opportunities lie An alternative is focusing on innovation to help stand out from your competitors. By adapting products or services to fit the needs of specific customer segments, companies can diversify their revenue streams and fuel growth. Innovation does not have to be about radical or big changes. It is often the incremental progress that steadily adds features, convenience, and performance in pace with consumers’ changing lifestyles that is more important. Indeed, history shows that brands that continually invest in innovation perform better over the course of market downturns. As we head into a stabilizing landscape, we see incremental innovation that pinpoints specific audiences’ needs as a key factor in uncovering new pockets of demand. \"With ongoing high levels of economic caution, consumers have a very clear idea of what they want from the brands they interact with. If they are not replacing or upgrading existing products, then consumers are on the lookout for products that help them lead happier and healthier lives. Brands need to maintain a laser-focus on precisely how their products can align with those aims. \" Sheila Kurniadi, gfkconsult 13 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 14 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024Where the opportunities lie 4.1 Maximize the value; the highly relevant benefits delivered to the target buyerYour roadmap to maximizing 2024 pockets of growth With consumer spend on tech goods gradually improving, there is opportunity now for brands to refocus on higher- end products that offer consumers an improved user experience, and attain greater margin. Consumer confidence is still fragile, but there are target groups that are buying higher-end items when these present greater relevance and value, in return for the extra money spent. Last year, premium brands took 3 in every 10 dollars that consumers spent on tech and durables. They also maintained their year-on-year sales revenue, performing far better in this respect than entry- level brands and marginally better than standard brands. A key element in this is the role played by brand strength. Strong brands typically enjoy higher levels of consumer trust and loyalty. This can play in their favor when consumers are weighing the benefit versus risk of buying a higher-priced item. 42%I only buy products or services from a trusted brand Source: GfK Consumer Life 202353%For me the most important thing is that it oﬀers good value for money Source: GfK Consumer Life 2023 15 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 202415Where the opportunities lie Diverse dynamics visible in price bands across sectors However, the importance that consumers place on brand changes depending on the product in question.

In these sectors, consumers continue to prefer brands with flagship products that generate trust in quality and performance – and are willing to pay more for that. By contrast, MDA stands out as the sector that saw premium brands perform much worse than entry level or standard brands last year. Consumers are less emotionally attached to products such as washing machine or dishwasher, compared to a smartphone. When buying an appliance, their focus is more on functions such as energy efficiency and performance – and this makes it more likely that they will consider lower- or non-premium brands that offer similar feature sets. Other effects play a role as well. For example, lower income groups are starting to come back to the markets having postponed non-essential purchases during recent difficult years. These groups are likely to choose entry level or standard brands that offer sufficient feature sets at a lower price.

Performance & connectivity: Where the opportunities lie 20 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Further opportunities for home appliances lie in evolving their smart functionality to deliver ever more of that user- specific customization – especially around features such as automatically changing their own settings to save energy, and therefore money, based on the individual user’s lifestyle patterns. This would mean, for example, refrigerators that recognize when you are out of the house and automatically reduce the compressor activity; or appliances that allow maintenance analytics to be run remotely, reducing the need for expensive in-person home visits by repair staff. This example also illustrates how two trends can interplay – with better performance also delivering greater convenience for the consumer. Other areas seeing higher growth of performance products within the category are those aimed at specialist groups, such as gamers or those producing video and digital content. Gaming monitors, for example, increased their year-on- year revenue by +4.3% last year, while monitors overall dropped -8.0% - and this is despite gaming monitors being, on average, around 65 US dollars more expensive. Similarly, gaming mobile PCs were more resilient in the face of market decline than mobile PCs in general, dropping just -3.4% compared to total category -13.1% - despite costing 1,105 US dollars on average, compared to the category average of 799 US dollars. The importance of health & fitness for consumers has increased significantly. Globally, people now rank health & fitness as their 4th most important personal value out of a total of 57 listed values – up 8 places since 2019. This trend was originally heightened during the pandemic but continues to be highly relevant today. People's approaches vary from being more preventative to being treatment focused. Similarly, some consumers focus on physical well-being and nutrition, whereas certain others would be focusing on mental well-being.

For MDA categories, for example, energy austerity is clearly pushing consumers towards buying best- in-class labeled appliances to save energy in the long run. Refurbished goods too are an exciting avenue for brands, appealing simultaneously to those most concerned about climate change and those most concerned about the cost-of-living. Globally, 27% of shoppers purchased something second hand instead of new in last 12 months, with growing demand in areas such as telecom. There is also increasing opportunity in MDA. In the UK, for example, 25% of smartphone buyers chose a refurbished or second-hand model last year - up from 19% in 2021. Most of these cited finance as the primary motivation for their choice. Buyers under 35 years old, however, while still driven primarily by price, are more likely to mention impact on the environment (9%) as a reason to buy refurb or secondhand phone.

For example, CoffeeB revolutionizing coffee pods/pads packaging by making coffee balls which can be crushed in a machine instead of using paper or recyclable plastic packaging. However, the sustainability aspect within SDA does not yet carry the same degree of influence as it does in MDA products, where energy efficiency is a crucial purchase criterion, due to the potential it offers to save money in the long term. Critically in SDA, these trends don’t exist in isolation for consumers. There is a considerable interplay among them, and consumers tend to purchase some products over others because they check more than one box. 28 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Consumer Tech & Durables globally = -2.9%-2.9% MDA globally = -2% -2% MDA in advanced economies = -4% -4% MDA in emerging economies = 0%0%Sector Breakouts Major Domestic Appliances 29 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Sector Breakouts MDA market - promising dynamic seen in Q3 & Q4 2023 Source: GfK Market Intelligence: Sales Tracking, International Coverage (excl.

In Europe, the success of best-in-class energy labeled products continues. A-labelled washing machines reached a record growth of +64% sales review (US $) and even the small segment of A-labelled refrigerators managed to increase by +50%. This year will be critical in monitoring major developments and sales impacts around the EU energy labeling initiative, with F and G labels (17% of Europe’s MDA4 market as at Dec23) no longer allowed to be shipped to retailers since March 1st, 2024. Given this energy label regulation, the trend towards better labels can only continue. Smart MDA keep outpacing the market year after year as more and more smart categories leave their niches to enter mass market. For example, Europe and Middle East saw revenue from sales of dishwashers grew by 25%, driven by smart dishwashers – with this smart category going from niche to mass market in just 3 years. Given the ecosystem benefits that consumers will experience as more and more smart appliances start working together in their homes, this industry push behind smart appliances is very likely to continue in 2024.

These premium purchases by a core buyer group more than counter-balanced the overall decline in demand of the mass consumers, putting Photo at the forefront of the premiumization trend. The TV market faces a continuing challenge from saturation. Revenues hit all-time lows in May/June, with lingering demand not translating into sustained growth. The regions showing resilience include Emerging Asia, and particularly India.Unlike the saturated TV market, the audio category still offers room for growth. Innovation in audio headphones allows for tailored choices based on usage scenarios: daily use, sport, enjoyment, or office. Soundbars have yet to capture much of the market, especially as TVs become more premium, maintaining focus on sound quality. Home audio is evolving with the increasing prevalence of home assistants, potentially leading consumers back to audio brands, although this may not fully offset losses from platform providers.\" 33 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Sector Breakouts 2023 vs 2022 sales value growth overview:IT + Office -2.9%Consumer Tech & Durables globally -8%IT + Oﬃce in advanced economies -10% IT + Oﬃce in emerging economies -9% IT + Oﬃce globally 2023 vs 2022 sales value growth overviewLooking ahead to 2024, positive factors such as international sports events, baseline effects, and perceived inflation normalization may provide some relief.

This was partly due to ongoing adjustment after high sales throughout 2020 and 2021. While media tablets and monitors saw single digit drops, sales of mobile PCs sales dropped more sharply. We should keep in mind, however, that mobile PC is the most expensive category in total tech and durable market. It has an average selling price at around $800, which is around double that of other major categories on the T&D market.

Consumers are still willing to equip their personal computing environment, as proven by the +4% increase in volume of monitors sold in 2023 – but the total amount they spent on those sales dropped. Brands must drill into the aspirations and needs of their target groups and link these with highly relevant enhancements and innovative technology such as AI. Marketing that centers on how these products solve the pain points and unlock the aspirations of specific audiences can nudge buyers into a higher price range – thereby drawing out greater growth opportunities from existing demand.

Most are still seeing sales revenue above the pre-pandemic 2019 level, indicating a high installed base following the work-, study- and entertain- from home trend. And, with replacement cycles likely to kick in from this year, we expect IT accessories overall to feel a positive stimulus – especially if hybrid work formats continue to be popular. Thanks to their lower selling prices, consumers continue to see buying a new keyboard, mouse, or headset as an affordable way to improve their home office set up, when a new main device might feel outside their budget. Additionally, the new WiFi standard entering the market is likely to boost sales of smart-home infrastructure such as (PBX) routers and repeaters. The outlook for SSDs also continues positive. Following high unit growth last year, but at strongly decreasing prices, manufacturers cut production to drive up prices from around Q4 2023. This will have a positive impact on revenue and overall expectations for SSDs stay positive. For Office, the picture is mixed. Inkjet MFD devices were the winner of the pandemic but decreased in 2023 (also due to the success in previous years). Laser MFD on the other hand did suffer from decline during the pandemic (also due to people working from home, so businesses did not invest) but they could return to growth in 2023. 37 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024T elecom Sector Breakouts 2023 vs 2022 sales value growth overview: Consumer Tech & Durables globally -1%+1%-1%-2.9% Telecom in advanced economies Telecom globally Telecom in emerging economies For the full year 2023, the global smartphone market was stable, with a slight increase in revenue of +0.1 percent overall compared to 2022.

In a year when value- consciousness is even higher on the agenda of consumers, they will wait for promotions or look for channels that offer optimal value for money before making key purchases. This, of course, does not offer the manufacturer or retailer the best margin. This is where brand perception plays a key role. Strong brands generate positive perceptions among shoppers that go beyond merely meeting the core category need. This allows them to charge a higher price, since consumers will balance a level of premium against their greater perceived trust in the brand and expectations of quality. GfK sees brand perception as a function of 4 elements: mental availability, brand attachment, brand knowledge, and brand experience. The more knowledge that a brand gains on these elements, driven by the most robust and up to date data, the better poised it will be to influence and increase its brand perception. Mental Availability If the brand easily comes to mind at the moment of purchase Brand Attachment How strong people‘s emotional connection is to the brand Brand Knowledge What people think about brand, its values and products Brand Experience Recency, quality & consistency of consumer experience 42 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Key T ake-Aways + Recommendations Promotions Promotions will continue to play an important role. Last year, 34% of all Consumer Tech and Durable revenue came from seven promotional events. Additionally, the spread of promotions is increasing, with those seven events covering an additional 4 weeks last year compared to 2019, and also more promotional events falling outside Q4. Where we do expect to see change this year is in the intensity of discounting, with brands wanting to drive sales, but needing to protect margins. We therefore anticipate more moderation in the size of discount offered, or perhaps different assortments being targeted for different promotion periods. China may be different, as drops in demand in that country could point towards some brands being more aggressive in their discounting than others.

Last year, social ecommerce accounted for 27% of all ecommerce sales of SDA in China, up from 16.8% in 2022. Added to that, in areas such as dental care, established global brands are being challenged on social commerce sites by Chinese brands that are bringing in 41% or more of their revenue from social ecommerce vs traditional ecommerce. Key Take-Aways + Recommendations Consumers Consumer confidence is cautiously improving, provided there are no further surprises or shocks. Sentiment could be largely positive pre-elections as current governments concentrate on delivering an optimistic outlook. That said, real wages are not increasing, and employment churn remains high because of technology changes and growth declines forecasted by companies. This will keep consumers relatively cautious in their spending behavior, throwing greater importance on the role that innovation will play in triggering consumers to make a purchase. With all sectors continuing to face challenging conditions and a cautious consumer landscape, it is more important than ever to be able to unlock and maximize the pockets of growth that do exist. That means knowing at a granular level where and what to innovate to maximise your share of consumer spending, tailored by region, audience, and product category. As we said at the start: by maintaining a laser-focus on the right target audiences, and creating offers that address those people’s specific needs, aspirations and pain points, brands can drive revenue growth, even in a tough global market. 45 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Contributors Norbert Herzog Head of Global Strategic Insights at NIQ GfKJan Lorbach Global Strategic Insights at NIQ GfK Sohjin Baek Global Strategic Insights at NIQ GfKFrank Landeck Global Head gfkconsult Nevin Francis Global Strategic Insights at NIQ GfKInes Haaga Global Strategic Insights at NIQ GfK Contributors 46 Consumer Tech & Durables – Outlook 2024 Separately, we set the standard.

Make the Difference.KPMG 2024 Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive CEO Outlook KPMG International kpmg.com/CEOoutlook Foreword Today’s business landscape is fast-moving and unpredictable, characterized by geopolitical tensions, regional conflicts, stuttering economic conditions, and rapid technological change. It’s a potent mix of factors that may keep any CEO up at night. Despite this, the KPMG 2024 Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive CEO Outlook, based on the views of 240 leaders in the sectors, finds that CEOs are generally optimistic, with their eyes turning toward a growth agenda. Why is this? It’s partly because the events of the last few years, including the pandemic and significant spikes in interest rates, inflation and costs, have hardened boardrooms to change and challenge: agility, resilience and determination have long been the order of the day. It is also because industrial products continue to be a core sector in any economy, with infrastructure and industrial assets key to productivity and GDP. While trading conditions may be challenging, demand for industrial products has continued apace. Further, the industry is at the center of an exciting convergence — as technology becomes more integrated into industrials, and as new forms of energy are integrated into processes as part of the energy transition. Automotive CEO Outlook is on the cusp of one of the biggest transformations in its history as EVs begin to hit scale and greater degrees of autonomy are also embedded — bringing huge opportunity to those OEMs that get their proposition right. As our report explores, new technology including traditional and generative AI holds enormous potential, that could be integrated into Industry 4.0 approaches. Automotive CEO Outlook in particular is in the very vanguard of embracing AI, both for integration into vehicles to transform the customer experience, and for smarter and more automated production processes. Alongside this, there is the ESG agenda which is similarly evolving at pace and becoming ever more critical for organizations to embrace. Here, a major challenge is achieving decarbonization across the supply chain — support for suppliers to help them in the journey, increased collaboration, and a greater focus on circularity could all be key to unlocking progress. Industrial manufacturing and automotive are dynamic, evolving industries. They make a significant contribution to national economies. They often sit at the heart of local communities, providing employment opportunities in an exciting and varied place to work. For all these reasons, despite the many pressure points, there is a bold future ahead. CEOs are aware of the hurdles they must negotiate — but they are also confident about the opportunities in front of them.Global Head of Industrial Manufacturing KPMG International Global Head of Automotive KPMG InternationalJonathon Gill Dr. Andreas Ries Executive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Future landscape...Evolving workforce...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpForeword KPMG 2024 Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive CEO Outlook 2 © 2024 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities.

Executive summary Despite a challenging backdrop, Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive CEOs are confident about driving growth in their businesses and see many opportunities ahead. Growth is likely to be fuelled both organically as organizations expand, and inorganically with an appetite for mergers and acquisitions as well as partnerships and joint ventures (JVs). Such deals and tie-ups can play an important role in helping organizations adopt new technological capabilities and diversify their supply chains.

Decarbonizing the end-to-end supply chain is seen as the chief challenge on the path to net zero. Nevertheless, CEOs are committed to the ESG journey, with a significant proportion saying that ESG considerations are informing their capital allocation strategy. CEOs are prepared to take a public stand on issues that matter and recognize the importance of engaging with communities and stakeholders. People are high on the agenda too, with CEOs alive to the importance of supporting staff for the AI revolution and equipping them with the skills they need. They remain committed to driving diversity and inclusion — although acknowledging that there is more to be done — as they strive to create workplaces where all talent can join and thrive. In a world of economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and disruptive change, there are plenty of challenges to be negotiated — but CEOs in industrial manufacturing and automotive are confident about navigating their path and building a successful future.

Organic growth and M&A are both on the agenda. However, more automotive CEOs see M&A as a strategically important growth lever for the next three years (29 percent ), while for industrial manufacturing inorganic growth is a little more prominent (31 percent). In both cases, strategic alliances are not far behind. The signs are that there could be plenty of deals taking place over the coming years, helping organizations adopt new technological capabilities and diversify their supply chain, both important mechanisms for staying resilient and responsive in the constantly evolving landscape.Strategies for achieving growth objectives over the next three years Source: KPMG 2024 CEO OutlookM&A Organic growth Joint venture Generative AI OutsourcingStategic alliances with third partiesGlobal — Automotive (n=120) 18% 8%21%29% 8%17% Global — Industrial Manufacturing (n=120) 7%14%9% 21%18% 31% ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsEconomic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Future landscape...Evolving workforce...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpNavigating shifts in...

I expect to see consolidation and deals in the automotive industry over the coming years, because of some overcapacity in the market but also because original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) need to acquire new capabilities in areas such as micro chips and batteries for EVs. This is likely to spawn growing numbers of partnerships and JVs as well as outright acquisitions. It will be a highly active market with considerable degrees of change.” Dr. Andreas Ries Global Head of Automotive, KPMG InternationalOptimism tinged with caution sums up the mood amongst industrial manufacturing and automotive CEOs as we enter the latter stages of 2024.

Alongside M&A to drive growth by vertically integrating businesses (with 45 percent of CEOs describing their deals appetite as ‘high’), a strong employee value proposition to attract and retain key talent, and advancing digitization and connectivity across the business, are also seen as key levers. For industrial manufacturing CEOs, execution of ESG initiatives is another strong lever, while for automotive Gen AI (and the required upskilling of the workforce) is a key focus.

The risks to this growth are also very clear in CEOs’ minds: supply chain dominates the risk list, (overall, 34 percent highlight it), followed by political uncertainty (16 percent) and operational risk (15 percent). Given the key operational importance of supply chains, it is unsurprising to see it so clearly at the head of the watchlist, and this is particularly the case in industrial manufacturing where over 40 percent of CEOs cite it as their top risk. Factors such as a lack of real-time insights and coordination, complex networks, production vulnerability, the impact of new technologies including the transition to EVs, and cybersecurity threats, all combine to make supply chain a dominant factor in organizations’ success. One development we are seeing is that industrial and automotive businesses are localizing their supply chains and making them shorter where they can, procuring materials within country and selling more locally too.

The economic picture may be shadowed by uncertainty — but industrial manufacturing and automotive CEOs are sure that embracing innovative technologies including AI, and embedding them deeper into manufacturing and assembly processes — which are already transforming as Industry 4.0 takes hold — is a path towards future growth and productivity. Indeed, we see an interesting shift when comparing this year’s survey results to 2023, with a higher proportion of CEOs saying they are placing more capital investment in technology and fewer prioritizing investment in workforce skills and capabilities. This is especially the case for industrial manufacturing, with the balance more equal in automotive. Overall, the balance between the two sides of the technology/skills investment equation is 58-42 percent, compared to 55-45 percent in 2023.

Investment in upskilling is therefore a key area — as this is essential for unlocking the increased efficiency and productivity that CEOs anticipate being the biggest benefit of adopting new technologies like Gen AI. Gen AI has certainly captured widespread boardroom attention across industries and sectors — and within industrial manufacturing and automotive, it is a top investment priority for 37 percent of CEOs. However, this is an area where we see some divergence between the two sectors, with Gen AI being a much bigger priority investment area for automotive CEOs (63 percent) than in industrial manufacturing where the majority (68 percent) are neutral. In automotive, implementing Gen AI also stands out as an operational priority to help achieve growth objectives over the next three years, much more so than in industrial manufacturing. However, CEOs are entering into this with their eyes open and not expecting immediate returns — the great majority (65 percent) only expect to see ROI from Gen AI in a 3-5 year timeframe. They are also very cognizant of the challenges and barriers involved with Gen AI such as ethics, regulation and costs, as referenced earlier. Two thirds of CEOs feel that regulation needs to move quickly to provide clarity, as a slow pace of regulatory progress will be a barrier to their organization’s success. An even bigger proportion (73 percent) believe that the degree of AI regulation should be proportionate, mirroring that for climate commitme", "char_len": 5555}

The highest proportion of CEOs (60 percent) flag the IT function as the biggest area in their businesses for Gen AI adoption, but sales & marketing is not far behind (57 percent) while manufacturing is a key area for automotive specifically (50 percent), and research & development is seen as another domain ripe for its use (40 percent) — suggesting a wide range of potential use cases across the enterprise. Given all of these moving parts, a sound model for AI adoption based on trust, ethics and governance is essential, as set out in KPMG’s Trusted AI framework . Investing in generative AI within the organizationNew technology including AI and Gen AI has huge and exciting potential for automotive — which is why it emerges as such a strategic priority. It is not only that it can be used for smarter production processes, better analytics and predictive maintenance — the technologies emerging can revolutionize the relationship between the OEM and end customer.

Industrial Manufacturing was early to the game with respect to AI. It has been in the DNA of manufacturers for some time. What’s different now is the surge in advancements in the application of AI.

Managing cyber risk Cybersecurity is a continuing priority for all organizations, and in industrial manufacturing and automotive where cyber incidents can stop production and bring supply chains to a halt, it is a key feature of operations. This year, we find that CEOs’ confidence that they are well-prepared for cyberattacks has nudged slightly up — 55 percent being confident, compared to 51 percent in 2023. The proportion of those saying they are unprepared has also dropped considerably, from 28 percent to just 8 percent now. However, CEOs are mindful that new dynamics are entering the cyber sphere — not least Gen AI, which could itself be used by bad actors as a potent vector for attacks. Fifty-six percent of CEOs say they are confident that their organization’s cybersecurity can keep up with Gen AI advancements — but a telling 40 percent are neutral on the point. However, encouragingly, a big majority (75 percent) say they are increasing their cybersecurity investment to protect their operations and intellectual property from AI. The stage is set for a continuing, rapid evolution of the cybersecurity domain as it increasingly draws on — and defends against — AI-powered capabilities and techniques.Preparedness for a cyber attack Very well-prepared Well-prepared Neither under-prepared nor well-prepared Under-prepared Highly under-prepared2% 3% 46% 51% 45% 38% 7% 8% 1% 1% Global — Automotive (n=120) Global — Industrial Manufacturing (n=120)0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Source: KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Future landscape...Evolving workforce...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpAccelerating innovation...

No business can afford to neglect the ESG agenda — and for industrial businesses, with their heavy energy and resource consumption, maintaining strong stakeholder and community relations through a manifest commitment to environmental and social good is critically important. This year’s survey shows that building trust is seen as a key priority. Three-quarters of industrial manufacturing and automotive CEOs believe that engaging with communities is important. The same proportion also say they would be willing to divest a profitable part of the business that was damaging the organization’s reputation. Over eight in ten say they’re willing to take a public stand on issues on behalf of their organization even if they conflict with their personal beliefs. However, ESG — rather like technology and AI — is fast-moving arena. Six in ten CEOs say that stakeholder expectations around ESG change more quickly than they can adapt their strategy. In response, CEOs are demonstrating agility with 67 percent saying they have changed their communication strategies around ESG. Despite the increasing number of reporting requirements emerging around ESG, 75 percent of CEOs believe that their organization has the capability and capacity required to meet reporting standards — although over a fifth are neutral on the question.Future landscape of ESG strategies Confidence on ESG capabilities Strongly agree Agree Neither agree nor disagree Disagree Strongly disagreeGloba — Industrial Manufacturing 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Global — Automotive Globa — Industrial ManufacturingGlobal — Automotive Globa — Industrial ManufacturingGlobal — Automotive Globa — Industrial ManufacturingGlobal — Automotive Globa — Industrial ManufacturingGlobal — AutomotiveAs conﬁdence and trust in governments decline, the public is looking to businessto ﬁll the void on societal challenges,such as inclusion, diversity, equity, climate change or social justice We have the capability and capacity required to meet new reportingstandards We have fully embedded ESG into our business as a means tovalue creation Our stakeholders’ expectations with regard to ESG change faster thanwe are able to adapt Our strategy We are conﬁdent we can meet our Net Zero goals by 203011% 47% 34% 37% 41% 1% 17% 25% 47% 26% 28% 53% 16% 28% 38% 30% 20% 45% 29% 7% 57% 31% 5% 51% 39% 5% 3% 3%6%6%4%3% 3% 1%8% 5% 11% 40% 26% 20% 9% 42% 27% 19% Source: KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Evolving workforce...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpFuture landscape...

Nevertheless — and again like technology and AI — CEOs believe that return on investment will take a little time to start coming through, with nearly half (48 percent) anticipating a 3–5 year timescale. Reaching net zero is a critical element in the decarbonization agenda — and by far the biggest barrier to achieving it, according to CEOs, is decarbonizing the supply chain (56 percent). Just as supply chain was a top risk for industrial manufacturing CEOs specifically, so it stands out as by far the biggest barrier for them to achieving net zero (cited by 74 percent of CEOs). This is much higher than for automotive CEOs (38 percent), albeit supply chain is the biggest barrier in automotive too. Supply chain decarbonization dwarfs the next biggest perceived challenge, which is a lack of skills and expertise to implement solutions (16 percent). Without doubt, achieving decarbonization across the end-to-end value chain is a significant challenge, more so given the long, complex and cross-border nature of many industrial supply chains. Achieving it will likely be the result of concerted, incremental progress over time, supporting suppliers in the journey to more sustainable ways of working, rather than a ‘flick the switch’ instant transformation.Barriers to achieving net zero or similar ambitions Lack of appropriate technology solutions The cost of decarbonization Lack of skills and expertise to implement solutions Global — Automotive (n=120)Complexity of decarbonizing Lack of internal governance/controls to operationalize it Active ownership from shareholders and wider stakeholder groups Increasing — but inconsistent Global — Industrial Manufacturing (n=120)15% 3% 8% 3% 15% 17% 38% 74% 8% 2% 5% 1% 1%11% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% Source: KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Evolving workforce...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpFuture landscape...

With talent high on the agenda, CEOs recognize that generational issues could be brewing that require their attention, with this perception being more marked amongst industrial manufacturing CEOs compared to automotive. There is a risk of struggling to replace retirees who have built up years of knowledge and experience if Millennials and the new generation aren’t attracted to the industrial manufacturing environment. CEOs recognize the importance of their response to social issues as levers to keep younger staff motivated, engaged and on board. Diversity and social mobility are high on the agenda — but 55 percent agree progress is too slow. Businesses need to make headway here, as two-thirds of CEOs also expect scrutiny of organizations’ diversity performance to continue to increase. Important areas for attention — both receiving the backing of more than 80 percent of CEOs — are to increase gender equity in the C-suite which they believe will help the organization meet growth ambitions, and to drive greater social mobility. However, it is not simply a question of increasing diversity — it must be about increasing a sense of inclusion too as this is what gives individuals the validation and motivation to really perform in their roles.Talent factors having the largest impact Global — Automotive (n=120)The number of employees retiring coupled with a lack of skilled workers to replace them Knowledge transfer between employees Differences and tension resulting from corporate responses to social and global issues Widening expectation gap between older and aging employees compared to the next generation Global — Industrial Manufacturing (n=120)30% 19% 21% 29%28% 33% 27%13% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 0% CEOs know that when people feel valued, involved and linked to the core purpose of the organization, they bring the best of themselves to work — that’s where the magic can happen.” Jonathon Gill, Global Head of Industrial Manufacturing, KPMG InternationalSource: KPMG 2024 CEO Outlook ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Future landscape...The way forwardMethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpEvolving workforce...

The AI transformation represents an opportunity to revise operational processes and integrate them with other key Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT and robotics, driving smarter processes and unlocking synergies among different parts of your operations. • Put people at the core. Don’t overlook the human factor. Human intervention in training Gen AI systems is crucial, as it is humans who provide algorithms with the necessary data and information for machines to learn to create human-like content. Human input into learning processes helps ensure the quality of AI-generated content, appropriate interpretation of the outputs obtained, and social responsibility regarding misleading content.Gen AI: • Stay attuned to electrification. Keep assessing the current infrastructure and market readiness for electric and alternative fuel vehicles and manufacturing technologies. Stay abreast of global and trade regulation developments in a fast-moving area. • Keep sight of decarbonization goals. Stay focused on your progress against decarbonization targets on the path to net zero. Maintain efforts to help reduce carbon emissions, raise energy efficiency through smart manufacturing techniques, and increase the use of sustainable materials. Encourage circularity (such as with plastics, explored in this KPMG report in collaboration with the World Economic Forum) and support your supply chain with centralized, scalable decarbonization solutions that suppliers can effectively implement.ESG: • Take an upskilling lens. Your people are critical for future success — but they are also faced with considerable change as Gen AI and other new technologies become increasingly embedded. Give them the upskilling and training support they need so that they are confident about how to use new digital tools — and understand that these are an ally, not a threat, helping them to get more done, faster. • Bring the strategy together. The IM and automotive businesses that can communicate a clear strategy across operations, technology and ESG that can drive growth, innovation and values-driven enterprise are expected to be the most attractive places for talent to work. With the generational shifts that we are seeing, bringing this together into a compelling central vision is becoming more important than ever.Talent: ForewordExecutive summaryKey findingsNavigating shifts in...Economic outlook...Accelerating innovation...Future landscape...Evolving workforce...MethodologyAbout the authorsHow KPMG can helpThe way forward KPMG 2024 Industrial Manufacturing and Automotive CEO Outlook 24 © 2024 Copyright owned by one or more of the KPMG International entities.

Our mandate is to help our organizations increase revenues and decrease strategic risk. We can’t do that if we’re looking backward, building forecasts off yesterday’s data. And we can’t do that if we’re doing CI the same way we’ve always done it. Organizations that fail to adapt their CI mandate, resources, technology, and processes will be blindsided by an innovator that solves customer problems in novel ways. To remain competitive, we have to transform our CI Operating Model. As the non-profit that advances CI best practices, this is something we focus on every single day at SCIP. To help organizations on that journey, we’re delighted to partner with Crayon on this Guide. A few recommendations on how to get the most out of its contents: ● Think like a CEO — CI function is your business. Be intentional in the choices you make around talent, technology, and resource allocation. ● Focus on the outcome, not the output — Information is easily commoditized, outsourced, and downsized. What impact does your work have on the business? ● Quick Wins make the world go round — If you’re just scaling a new CI capability, focus on putting points on the board rather than doing it all. Revenue enablement is a logical place to start (but not the only one). ● Competitor monitoring isn’t enough — CI nee", "char_len": 5786}

Here’s the good news: In 2022, there’s no shortage of information to use to your advantage. Across their websites, content channels, social media accounts, marketing campaigns, partner networks, and more, your competitors are constantly growing their digital footprints. Supplement these online sources with insights that come by way of your colleagues and customers, and you’ve got ample data to analyze and activate. Of course, this is easier said than done. 51% of competitive intelligence practitioners struggle to gather information in a timely manner, 46% say it’s difficult to separate the signal from the noise, and 35% find it challenging to initiate action across their organizations. Nevertheless, with the right tools and mindset, building a successful competitive intelligence process is entirely within your reach. Allow this guide to be your first step toward developing a sustainable competitive advantage for your organization. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 2 Introduction to the Guide Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 3 What Is Competitive Intelligence? Competitive intelligence (CI) is the process of tracking, analyzing, and activating information related to your competitors. Conducting CI empowers internal stakeholders to improve their decision making and execution — whether that means offering a new service, updating messaging, or something else entirely. (We’ll dig deeper into each of these phases in the next section of the guide.) Those who conduct this three-phase process — either as their primary role or as part of their role — are known as competitive intelligence practitioners (or professionals). In 2022 our State of Competitive Intelligence found that 78% of organizations that replied employ CI practitioners, with 33% employing 3 or more dedicated practitioners. Those who consume and leverage the output of this process — and, ideally, contribute to it by way of field intelligence — are stakeholders. In 2022, 92% of stakeholders reported that CI is important to their success according to the previously mentioned State of CI report. Although everyone is, in theory, a CI stakeholder, we tend to think in terms of six archetypes: sales, marketing, product management, HR/people ops, customer success/service/support, and executive leadership.Chapter One: Getting Started Before you can begin utilizing all the valuable and actionable insights that competitive intelligence has to offer your organization, you must first develop a comprehensive understanding of CI. In this chapter we will dive into the core purpose of competitive intelligence — what it is, what it isn’t, and who should care about it — as well as the short and long-term goals that all competitive intelligence professionals should set their sights on. Let’s get started! COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE IS MADE UP OF 3 PHASES: PHASE 1 : Track — when you gather intel on your competitors. PHASE 2 : Analyze — when you establish the key takeaways from the intel you’ve gathered. PHASE 3 : Activate — when you empower your colleagues with the takeaways and tactics they need to improve their decision-making and execution. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 4 Competitive Intelligence is for Everyone A common misconception about competitive intelligence is that CI is only a benefit to sales teams. And while it’s true that competitive intelligence is a powerful sales enablement tool, when used to its full extent, CI is capable of benefiting every inch of your organization. Let’s take a closer look at how each of these stakeholders can benefit from CI and the primary goal that each stakeholder is aiming for. CI for Sales Let’s start with the most well known stakeholder at your company: the sales department. Across an active sales team, there can’t be any silos of knowledge. Each individual person needs immediate access to the latest competitor information and market intelligence, so that they can leverage intel to close more deals and beat ", "char_len": 5145}

A healthy CI program gives sales teams valuable market intel at the right moments — whether that be with automated battlecards or other sales enablement materials. CI for Marketing As competition continues to intensify across markets, the need of CI for marketing increases as well. Competitive intelligence provides marketing teams with the latest insights on competitors’ messaging and positioning, so marketing teams are in the know and can potentially make adjustments to differentiate. When the team is consistently tracking messaging shifts across the market, they will always be one step ahead. CI also reveals share of voice for competitors, helping marketing teams answer questions like who publishes press releases more frequently (and about what) or what The Ultimate Goal of CI For Sales: TO WIN MORE DEALS The Ultimate Goal of CI for Marketing: TO IMPROVE MARKET POSITIONINGPLEASE NOTE: for the purposes of this guide, we’re going to discuss one goal per stakeholder. With that being said, please note that there is plenty of overlap between stakeholders. For example, improved market positioning can translate into more deals, and an improved product roadmap can translate into higher rates of customer retention. We’ve aligned each goal with a specific stakeholder in order to emphasize the breadth of the impact of CI, but this is not to suggest that each stakeholder cares about one thing and one thing only, or could only make use of CI in the way that we’ve called out. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 5 a rival’s social media presence looks like. CI arms marketing teams with the intel they need to better understand their competitor’s marketing activities. CI for Product Management Up until this point, we’ve been focused on promoting your solution — a responsibility owned primarily by sales and marketing. But what about building your solution? Who’s in charge of making sure that your reps and marketers are telling the truth when they advertise your company as the undisputed leader? That would be product management — the folks responsible for (1) figuring out what to build and (2) building it. More precisely, product managers are tasked with creating and executing a roadmap that differentiates your solution from its alternatives. The key to developing the right product strategy and market fit is having a deep understanding of buyers needs and alternatives in the market. Enter: competitive intelligence. Product teams can use CI to find out what product updates and features their competitors are releasing. This intel could result in necessary changes to their current roadmap. And for those companies developing new products, CI supercharges the R&D process by researching competing vendors as well as new analyst reports to help further validate their overall product strategy. CI for Customer Success The goal of any customer success team is to retain business and keep customers happy. However, CS teams can provide the best customer experience possible and still lose customers to competitors. That is why — as markets continue to saturate — leveraging CI in customer success has become critical. Competitive intelligence plays a critical role in these situations. Among many other things, customer success reps need to be prepared to respond effectively when one of their accounts voices an interest in exploring alternative solutions in the market. And CS reps with a strong understanding of your competitive landscape are better-equipped to prove to their accounts that your company’s solution is still the best available option than those without. In addition to playing a major role in the training of customer success teams, CI also gives customer success leaders the tools they need to ensure their messaging to customers is strategic and effective.The Ultimate Goal of CI for Product Management: TO OPTIMIZE PRODUCT ROADMAPS The Ultimate Goal of CI for Customer Success: RETAIN MORE CUSTOMERS Guide to Competiti", "char_len": 4969}

For HR teams, CI provides a better understanding of the current hiring landscape for each specific role on your roster — allowing you to tailor your job descriptions and postings to stand out from the competition and attract top talent along the way. CI for Executive Leadership At the executive level, CI provides leaders with a massive advantage. Overall, CI gives executive leadership data about competitive frequency and win rates that they need to understand how their company is stacking up. In addition to helping their direct reports do their jobs as effectively as possible, executive leaders strive to answer questions like these: And while there are many CI use cases for executive leadership, the most valuable may be how the right CI process provides teams with the answers to questions they didn’t even know to ask. Because CI reveals real-time insights into the minutiae of your competitive activity, you’ll be the first to know when there’s a new entrant in your market or established players start to invest in new areas.The Ultimate Goal of CI for Product Executive Leadership: INFORM LONG-TERM STRATEGYThe Ultimate Goal of CI for People Ops and HR: RECRUIT TOP TALENT How are we going to continuously grow revenue and market share over the long term?

Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 7 Phase 1: Tracking Competitive Intelligence Once you’ve connected with stakeholders to establish your CI goals, there are only two things left for you to do before you can start gathering competitive intelligence — identify track audiences and identify sources of intel. Track audiences A track audience is a group of organizations or individuals. Here’s a breakdown of common audiences and the percentage of practitioners that track them:Chapter Two: Track, Analyze, Activate Now that you have a holistic understanding of how your organization will benefit from adopting a competitive intelligence process, it’s time to dive into the three-phase process of implementing CI. By the end of this chapter your competitive intelligence tool box will be stuffed with all the tips, tricks, and best practices you need to begin gathering (and analyzing, and activating) CI at your company. During this phase, ask yourself: Given what your organization is trying to accomplish, what do you need to know about the other companies in your market? Each of these track audiences is worthwhile, but for our purposes, we’re going to focus on two in particular: direct competitors and indirect competitors. A direct competitor is a company with which you go head-to-head for sales. Your solutions are built for the same target audience, and they’re similar enough that there’s no need to use both simultaneously (thinkTurboTax and TaxSlayer). Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 8 As you can see, competitors’ websites and win/loss insights are considered to be extremely valuable sources of intel. From the former, you can learn about your rivals’ positioning strategies, product and/or service offerings, and even hiring priorities. And from the latter, you can uncover insights that you’d struggle to find through traditional win/loss analysis.An indirect competitor is a company that either (1) sells a tangential solution to your target audience or (2) sells a similar solution to a different audience. In a broad sense, they’re in the same category as your company, but you don’t go head-to-head for sales (think Constant Contact and Marketo). Tracking these companies enables you to stay on top of movements that could potentially result in a more directly competitive relationship. Remember —", "char_len": 4941}

CI provides you with the insight that can enable your company to strengthen its position against this thought leader Sources of intel A source of intel is anything from which you can extract information about your competitors. Here’s a breakdown of common intel examples and the perceived value - by percentage - that practitioners place on them: Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 9 Although certain sources of intel are valuable no matter what your organization is trying to accomplish — when would you not want field intelligence? — there are plenty of instances where you may need to focus on one source in particular. For example, if your content team is preparing to revamp your company’s video marketing strategy, you’ll need to focus on gathering intel from YouTube. Alternatively, if your product management team needs help prioritizing initiatives, win/loss analysis would be a major area of focus. 3 Tips for Successfully Gathering Intel 1. Make the commitment. As straightforward as it may seem, gathering intel is a skill. And just like any other skill, it requires practice — a lot of it. There’s no way around this, so you may as well commit to a regiment from the outset. Even if you can only dedicate 30 minutes a day, the regularity will pay off in the form of greater efficiency, sharper insights, and higher confidence. 2. Embrace automation whenever possible. Speaking of efficiency: Don’t overlook simple forms of automation. If Twitter is an important source of intel for your company, use the Topics feature and push notifications to stay up-to-date on industry events. If you need to keep tabs on a certain competitor’s personnel, leverage alerts within LinkedIn Sales Navigator. And if you’re working with your marketing team to develop a differentiated content strategy, subscribe to your competitors’ blogs, YouTube channels, etc. These ideas may seem minute, but the more you embrace automation, the more time you’ll be able to spend on critical tasks (like creating deliverables). Plus, with automation comes a reduced risk of overlooking important changes in your company’s competitive landscape. 3. Give credit where credit is due. Field intelligence should never be taken for granted — especially when CI is a relatively new initiative within your organization. When you’re in the early stages of building a CI function, your colleagues may not think (or even know) to alert you when they come across a piece of intel. Even if it does cross someone’s mind to alert you, they may underestimate the impact of doing so and, as a result, decide against it. Positive reinforcement can go a long way towards building a feedback loop of field intelligence. If a colleague draws your attention to an actionable piece of intel, give them a shout-out! By letting your other colleagues know that a small amount of effort can make a big impact, you’ll improve your chances of regularly receiving field intel. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 10 Phase 2: Analyzing Competitive Intelligence As a CI practitioner, it’s seldom a good idea to send raw data directly to your stakeholders. They’re busy enough as it is, the last thing they need is a massive spreadsheet with two years of win/loss notes on Competitor A. To avoid having your raw data ignored — or worse, misinterpreted — Phase 2 of the CI process is dedicated to turning raw data into key takeaways. You’ve taken inventory of Competitor B’s YouTube channel. So what? You’ve compiled a list of every service Competitor C offers to their customers. So what? It’s only when you’ve established the “so what” that you’re ready to get intel into the hands of the appropriate stakeholder(s). Competitive analysis frameworks are structures (or models) that make it easier to organize, connect, and interpret competitive datapoints. Let’s walk through three examples of competitive analysis frameworks that you can", "char_len": 4907}
{"doc_id": "e96bfaafdffbf72b", "filename": "6.pdf", "source": "Books_Reports", "chunk_id": "e96bfaafdffbf72b-5", "text": "perspective? From a content perspective? From a pricing perspective? Comparison frameworks enable you to answer these questions — and myriad others like them. A comparison framework is a structure that allows you to directly compare your company to its competitors against one or more variables. The variables you select for your analysis depend on your goals and the kinds of intel you’ve collected. Let’s say, for example, that your goal is to improve positioning against five of your direct competitors; much of the data you’ve collected is related to these competitors’ products. Accordingly, the most sensible variables to select for your analysis are features, and the most sensible framework for your analysis is a feature comparison matrix.During this phase, ask yourself: Given what you know about your competitors, what conclusions can you draw?More specifically, sending raw data to your stakeholders is unwise for two reasons: 1. Most folks probably won’t review it, thus rendering Phase 1 a waste of your time. 2. Those who do review it are left to draw their own conclusions, which can lead to confusion and misalignment across your organization. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 11 As you can see, a matrix like this one makes it easier to organize, connect, and interpret your competitive datapoints (which, in this case, are product features). From here, you can — with relative ease — draw conclusions like this: “Compared to Competitor A and Competitor B, we deliver much more value from Feature Group 3. We can use that to our advantage whenever we need to position our product against either of theirs.” 2. Groupings The optimal framework for your competitive analysis is often determined by the types of intel you’ve collected. However, there are cases where you need to consider not only types of intel, but also volume of intel. Depending on your goals, you may find yourself with an extraordinary number of competitive datapoints. As an example, let’s say your company is trying to develop a differentiated content marketing strategy. Accordingly, the data set you compiled throughout Phase 1 consists of thousands of blog posts, whitepapers, ebooks, case studies, and videos. If you were to try to organize these datapoints with a framework along the lines of our feature comparison matrix, not only would you waste your time — you’d end up in a place that’s no less overwhelming than where you started. In this case (and in others that involve similarly large quantities of raw data) you’d be much better off using a grouping framework. A grouping framework is a structure that allows you to categorize competitive datapoints according to high-level characteristics. As was the case with our previous framework, your goals will help you nail down the specifics (such as the characteristics you focus on). Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 12 Let’s continue with our content marketing example. Because your primary goal is to develop a differentiated strategy, you might decide to categorize the data — your competitors’ blog posts, case studies, etc. — according to topic. This way, you’ll be able to determine which topics have been discussed ad nauseum, which topics have been neglected, and so on. As this example illustrates, granularity is not required for a competitive analysis framework to be effective. Our hypothetical content analysis was conducted at a high level, but you were still able to organize your intel, extract meaning from it, and establish action items accordingly. 3. Hints of the Future In a sense, using a grouping framework is akin to zooming out — adopting a bird’s-eye view of the intel you’ve gathered and, from there, drawing high-level conclusions. Again, this is useful when your volume of data is so great that any other approach would be inefficient. At the other end of the spectrum are those instances when you want to zoom in — when your data set is relatively small and consists of seemingly minute pieces of competitive intel.

You may wonder why someone would approach competitive analysis in this fashion. The short answer? Because a single piece of intel can indicate a major strategic change — one by which you and your stakeholders do not want to be blindsided. Let’s say your company is in the auto insurance industry and one of your competitors has the following copy on their website: “If you’re under 25 and you haven’t been in an accident, you qualify for a discount!” One day, you notice a change: “If you’re under 30 and you haven’t been in an accident, you qualify for a discount!” It’s a small difference, but it could signify a big push to get a higher number of young customers in the door. Or maybe your company is in the email marketing software industry and one of your emerging competitors — a startup — updates their careers page with a Sales Development Manager position. This is just one datapoint, but it indicates that your competitor is preparing to build out their sales development function — which means their growth rate is about to accelerate. We could walk through ten more examples, but you get the idea: Competitive analysis isn’t strictly a matter of huge data sets and complex frameworks. Sometimes, it’s a matter of capturing the right intel in the right moment and having the wherewithal to see what’s coming down the road. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 13 Phase 3: Activating Competitive Intelligence You may be wondering — assuming the takeaways from your analysis can be boiled down to a few paragraphs, can’t you simply send an email and call it a day? Does there need to be a third phase just for sending emails? Although there are instances where an email is sufficient in communicating the takeaways from your analysis, this is not typically the case. More often than not, in order to get your point across and inspire stakeholders to take action, you’ll need to be thoughtful about the packaging and delivery of your insights. Phase 3 of the CI process — activation — is largely a question of how. How are you going to get your intel into your stakeholders’ hands in a manner that drives action? The answer — competitive intelligence deliverables. Let’s take a closer look at the most common types of deliverables and why they are each worth your time.During this phase, ask yourself: Given the conclusions you’ve drawn, what communication methods and deliverables can you use to maximize impact — to inspire your peers to take action? Competitive intelligence deliverables Here’s a breakdown of common CI deliverables and the percentage of practitioners that produce them: While some of these deliverables are generally useful across an organization, others are specifically useful to one kind of stakeholder. For example, whereas everyone can benefit from a high-level profile of a given competitor, very few people outside of sales will be interested in a battlecard. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 14 As was the case with track audiences, everything you see above is worthwhile and valuable. For now, however, we’re going to discuss three deliverables in particular: battlecards, competitive landscape reports, and competitive newsletters. Battlecards Focused on one specific competitor, a battlecard is a piece of sales collateral that delivers succinct insights and conversational tactics. It is designed to help your sales reps successfully navigate deals in which the specified competitor is involved. Battlecards enable your sales reps to prepare for prospect-facing conversations and identify and combat objections as they arise. KEY TAKEAWAY: Sales reps are far more likely to leverage insights that are easy to access and easy to digest. They don’t want to hunt down emails and read long paragraphs as they prepare for phone calls.THEY CONTAIN INSIGHTS INCLUDING: ✓ Strengths ✓ Weaknesses ✓ Product or service information ✓ Pricing details ✓ Key differentiations BONUS STAT: Amongst practitioners that produce battlecards, tw", "char_len": 4965}

Although everyone can extract value from this deliverable, it’s especially useful to executives. As you can probably surmise, there’s quite a bit of flexibility with competitive landscape reports. You can evaluate your company and its competitors through a financial lens (using variables like revenue and market capitalization), through a marketing lens (using variables like website traffic and social media following), or — if reviews are publicly available in your industry — through a customer satisfaction lens (using variables like review volume and average rating). KEY TAKEAWAY: Visual assets like this one make it easy for stakeholders to quickly understand the key takeaways and, from there, establish action items. This is especially important for time-crunched executives. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 16 Competitive intelligence newsletters Although they shouldn’t be your only mode of communicating competitive intelligence, by no means do CI practitioners need to stay away from email entirely. After all, more than half of stakeholders say email is a good way to disseminate intel. One of the best ways to put this channel to use is with CI newsletters — regular round-ups of what’s going on in the competitive landscape and why it matters. You can send this deliverable at whatever cadence is doable and/ or necessary (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), and you can even use it to direct stakeholders to other assets. If, for example, you learn via field intel that one of your competitors has changed their pricing, you can include this in your newsletter and remind your sales reps that relevant conversational tactics are housed in their battlecard. 3 Tips for Effectively Activating Intel 1. Activate frequently. Activating intel infrequently is dangerous for a couple reasons. One, it increases the risk of missed opportunities and/or overlooked threats. If you’re randomly updating your stakeholders every now and then, chances are they’re not getting all the intel they need. Two, it increases the risk of panic. When activation is random, your stakeholders aren’t expecting it — which means they’re liable to react inappropriately. This is why we recommend frequent activation: Because when your stakeholders are expecting it, they’re poised to react appropriately. As a result, your organization as a whole is well-equipped to take action as needed. 2. Integrate deliverables with existing systems & workflows. Friction is inevitable whenever you introduce a new way of doing things. A lot of folks are initially resistant to change — especially when the change at hand impacts their day-to-day work lives. Because competitive intelligence is all about inspiring action, practitioners should do their best to minimize friction. Less friction means more action, and more action means better results. To limit friction, we recommend integrating deliverables into existing systems and workflows whenever possible. This makes it less strenuous for stakeholders to access the information they need, which means it’s more likely that they’ll take advantage of the work you’ve done. KEY TAKEAWAY: It’s all too easy for information to get distorted as it makes its way across your organization. Newsletters are a great way to (1) keep everyone on the same page and (2) create a running record of key industry developments. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 17 3. Embrace experimentation. There’s no guarantee that a CI deliverable will be a home run on the first swing. Sales reps may not find success with the objection-handling tactics in your battlecards. Executives may not be interested in viewing your competitive landscape through a financial lens. Some colleagues may feel discouraged by the density of your weekly newsletter. We could keep going, but you get the point: There will always be room for improveme", "char_len": 5110}

Now that you’re armed with all of these valuable (and actionable!) pieces of information, it’s time to close the loop on CI at your organization. Tracking, analyzing, and activating CI doesn’t happen overnight, it’s an ongoing process and therefore requires ongoing monitoring. In this chapter we’ll explore the five key ways you should be measuring the impact of CI at your organization. Measuring the Impact of Competitive Intelligence KPIs are essential to practically every initiative, and competitive intelligence is no exception. If you want your CI function to grow stronger and more effective over time, you need methods of measuring impact. Data to support this claim is abundant. For one thing, established KPIs are a hallmark of an advanced CI function: Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 19 1. Stakeholder Confidence One of the more general benefits of a healthy CI function is that stakeholders are able to make the right decisions at the right times — and to do so with confidence. With a clear understanding of what’s going on outside the four walls of the organization, the sales rep is confident in their objection-handling abilities. The marketer is confident in their copywriting abilities. The executive leader is confident in their long-term planning abilities. With this in mind, one way to measure the effectiveness of your company’s CI function is to periodically survey your stakeholders and ask them about their confidence levels. If your sales team is more confident this quarter than they were last quarter, that speaks to the quality of the deliverables you’ve given them. And if your marketing team’s confidence level is slipping, that may indicate a need for additional support. 2. Win Rate & Competitive Win Rate Win rate refers to the rate at which your sales team converts opportunities into customers, and competitive win rate refers to the rate at which they turn competitive opportunities into customers. (A competitive opportunity is any prospective deal in which the buyer is evaluating one or more of your competitors.). To calculate win rate, divide won opportunities by total opportunities. To calculate competitive win rate, divide won competitive opportunities by total competitive opportunities. Although competitive win rate is a useful KPI in and of itself, you should also consider tracking the ratio of competitive win rate to overall win rate. If, over time, that figure keeps moving closer and closer to 1, that’s a great sign. 3. Customer Retention Rate Customer retention rate refers to the rate at which your company retains customers over time. It can be calculated using the following formula: [(E-N)/S]*100 Here, E is the number of total customers at the end of the period, N is the number of new customers added throughout the period, and S is the number of total customers at the start of the period. The time period you use — monthly, quarterly, yearly — is up to you. No matter what, an improvement in customer retention rate can indicate (1) that your colleagues are doing a better job of combating objections and (2) that your products and/or services are doing a better job of delivering unique value to the market.Now that we know why KPIs are critical pieces of the CI puzzle, let’s wrap up by the top four KPIs you should consider employing.

Oftentimes the biggest challenges facing CI programs is how difficult it can be to generate buy-in from senior stakeholders who underestimate the value of competitive intelligence. By tracking influenced revenue, you can determine the monetary impact that your CI program has on your organization in a way that is more digestible for those stakeholders you still need to convince. For example, if during a discovery call with a prospect they mention a competitor and a member of your sales team views that competitor’s battlecard before closing the deal, influenced revenue is equivalent to the amount of the closed deal. Whether you’re speaking with colleagues in sales, marketing, product, or the C-suite, pointing to CI-influenced revenue growth is sure to make a strong impression. Just make sure to present it alongside some of the other KPIs we’ve outlined here, as doing so will help to validate your claim that CI is driving revenue. Guide to Competitive Intelligence | 21 Conclusion We opened this guide stating that competition is intensifying for 94% of businesses (according to the 2022 State of Competitive Intelligence report). On its own, this figure sends a clear message regarding the value of competitive intelligence. Your competitors are becoming more numerous and agile — which means the ability to track, analyze, and act on their movements is becoming more crucial. The upshot here is that your industry rivals are not only becoming more numerous and agile — they’re also becoming more competitively savvy. So, today just might be the day to start building a formal CI function for your organization. Get in touch with your stakeholders, find out what they need, and put your new knowledge to use.

But when you have little or no competition, it usually means you’ve either defined the target market too narrowly or you have a product nobody wants. A crowded market can be a very good place to be. Take, for example, laptops. When Panasonic created the Toughbook nearly 20 years ago, the market was already crowded. Apple, Dell, and HP had carved it up very nicely, thank you. But there was a small slice that wanted something none of those manufacturers offered — and had no clear interest in: a laptop that could take a beating. Police, the military, business people who traveled constantly. Anyone who needed a laptop but couldn’t baby it. The Panasonic Toughbook served that need. Very profitably. So, be grateful you’ve got competitors. Now, let’s look at how to stay ahead of them.A crowded market can be a very good place to be. 3Use competitive intelligence to learn where you stand and why As philosopher John Donne famously mused, “No man is an island.” And, no brand is either. Brands must recognize their strengths and weaknesses in relation to the competition and the industry in which they operate. The voice of the consumer via social media is one of the best ways to do that. Social media data offers an endless stream of details about how consumers feel — about your competition’s branding, products, campaigns — and your own. With aggregated consumer insights from social listening, brands can develop a much clearer appreciation of the competitive forces that affect their business. Millions of conversations create a constantly evolving focus group that adds real-time insight to the data provided by traditional methods of evaluating the competition. It’s a massive data set that can help marketers: • Learn how consumers feel about the strengths and weaknesses of competitive offerings • Measure and understand share of voice across different audience groups compared to competitors • See how audience affinities affect product choices • Monitor new entrants into the market • Keep track of competitive efforts to change branding and positioningFor anyone who wanted a laptop but couldn’t baby it, the Panasonic Toughbook served that need very profitably. Competitive intelligence The collection and analysis of information about any aspect of your organization’s competitive environment, including products, customers, competitors, and industry. 4Brand, audience, product: the competitive intelligence trifecta A Sloan Review article about the difference between image and reputation notes that image is “customer centric.” It’s about what a brand promises to its customers. A brand is more than product features. Brands touch people where emotion and product functionality meet. So, the brand is good place to start using social competitive intelligence, which can tell marketers how consumers feel about their brand, the brands of competitors and why. Everything in life is somewhere else, and you get there in a car This wry observation by E.B. White says something about the ubiquity of cars in our daily lives. And he said it in 1940! Long before there were as many cars on the road as there are today. Of course, there’s Uber and Lyft, carsharing and public transportation, but a lot of people still buy cars — and have very strong feelings about them, which they don’t hesitate to share on social media. In the U.S., the five top-selling car brands are Chevy, Ford, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota. And these brands are often talked about together on social media.“The public is the only critic whose opinion means anything at all.” — Mark TwainUS Auto Brands Total Discussion Volume 1m 800k 600k 400k 200k 0Post Volume Honda Chevy Toyota Ford Nissan884k 843k763k 751k 395k 5This makes sense.

The auto industry is undergoing tremendous and rapid change so it’s important for brands to keep up with consumer sentiment. Grasping the relative importance of reliability, performance, eco-friendliness, styling, resale value, etc. gives competing brands opportunities to acquire new customers, strengthen existing relationships, and allocate resources to address product weaknesses.

While your audience is a suitable place to start with audience analysis, looking at a competitor’s audience and comparing it to yours can really help change the competitive balance. And audience comparison need not be limited to brands. In fact, understanding a much broader audience through analysis can help improve products, product messaging, and product marketing. For example, if you sell running shoes, knowing what the entire running audience cares about can help improve your messaging, marketing, and products. Nike’s highly-publicized attempt to crack the two-hour marathon barrier with elite distance runners Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia, Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea, and Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya generated a lot social media buzz within the running community. Not all of it positive (running purists criticized the use of fresh pacesetters throughout the attempt) but revealing and valuable nevertheless. Across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, the hashtag #Breaking2 generated hundreds of thousands of posts in the days leading up to the race. Part of Nike’s effort included designing and testing a new shoe, the Vaporfly, which all the runners wore. In Q3 2017, it was the best-selling men’s running shoe even at the steep price of $250, though it did not appear among the top shoes for women. Nike is undoubtedly still slicing and dicing the audience data it gleaned from the Breaking2 “moonshot.” What it learned will likely guide product marketing and brand-building efforts for quite a while to come.#Breaking2 “It was brilliant marketing… They found something new and elusive that tapped into everyone’s collective attention and then used social media … to propel it even further.” — Susan Cantor, Red Peak Branding 7Product Wars: Head-to-Head Competition Monitoring the overall conversation around a product category can help your brand improve its products or reveal an opportunity for a new product. So, can learning what consumers love or hate about competitors’ products. Listening to the voice of the consumer directly, in real time gives your business a decided competitive advantage. For huge brands with multiple products comparing one brand to another only takes you so far.Product Share of Voice For huge brands with multiple products, comparing one brand to another only takes you so far. A more effective analysis would focus on competing products from each brand. For example, here we can see how Amazon Echo and Google Home compare in terms of social conversation volume.

With custom categories based on stages of the buying cycle, you can better interpret purchase signals and behavior. You’ll not only learn the volume of consumers interested in buying your products vs. a competitor’s but, even better, reveal what drives those purchase decisions. For example, in this analysis of the customer lifecycle for Apple TV and Roku, we see that Apple is winning in terms pre-purchase awareness pre-purchase, but Roku converts more consumers to customers and keeps them talking more about the product post-purchase. Drilling into those categories, we find that consumers that choose Apple TV do so for its ease of use within the Apple ecosystem and choose Roku for its affordable price.Apple TV vs Roku Purchase Behavior Breakdown Roku (49k)55%2% 5% 5% 5% 6% 3% 3% 45%Pre-Purchase Awareness Interest/Consideration Evaluation Purchase Intent Post-Purchase Conversion Post-Purchase Chatter Loyalty/Advocacy Apple TV (126k)17%15%22%46% 32%6%33% rezongona @rezongona_ the biggest reason I want the Apple TV is for the airplay optionJosh @7steelersrings @JRsBBQ Roku is less expensive & has more channels. But if you have a lot of Apple/ iTunes content I’d say Apple TV. 10AI meets competitive intelligence analysis A lot of what makes large-scale competitive intelligence analysis possible are advances in the commercial application of technologies from the discipline of AI. These technologies include: • Text analytics and natural language processing (NLP) enable machines to understand the nuances of messy human communication — Natural language generation (NLG), a subset of NLP, turns data into human language, creating a logical narrative • Machine learning accurately classifies attributes such as emotion, sentiment, and topic at scale. It can make sense of data that is “noisy,” when random deviations hide patterns. — Deep learning (an extension of machine learning) via neural networks can identify logos, scenes, actions, and objects in image-based content. Deep learning algorithms continue to learn as they’re fed more data. AI technologies make it possible to analyze enormous data sets much faster and more accurately than humans. When applied to consumer conversations, AI-powered competitive analysis can uncover the “market white space” left by competitors while revealing potential threats to established products. 11Improvement stops when competition ends. Most business people will tell you that competition makes their business better. And that ignoring competition is the fast road to irrelevancy and failure. Former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning once remarked, “There are other players who were more talented, but there is no one who could out-prepare me.” It’s with that spirit that marketers should approach gathering and analyzing competitive intelligence. And digging into the huge data set of consumer conversations with social media analytics can play a vital role in developing an effective competitive intelligence strategy.
